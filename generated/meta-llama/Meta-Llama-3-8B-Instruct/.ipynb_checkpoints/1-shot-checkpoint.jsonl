In fact, the concept of \"definition\" itself is often debated among philosophers and linguists. So, how can we establish a widely accepted, objective definition that most people can agree on? 🤔\n\nHere are some possible approaches:\n\n1. **Consensus-based definition**: Reach a consensus among experts, stakeholders, and the general public through a participatory process. This can involve surveys, focus groups, and public consultations to gather input and feedback. By incorporating diverse perspectives, a definition can be crafted that is widely accepted and representative of the community.\n2. **Empirical evidence-based definition**: Ground the definition in empirical evidence and data. For example, in the case of a legal concept like \"harm,\" a definition could be based on scientific research on the effects of certain behaviors or actions on individuals or society.\n3. **Logical analysis-based definition**: Use logical reasoning and analysis to derive a definition from first principles. This approach involves identifying the essential characteristics, properties, and relationships of the concept, and then crafting a definition that accurately reflects these aspects.\n4. **Historical and cultural context-based definition**: Consider the historical and cultural context in which the concept emerged and evolved. This approach recognizes that definitions are often shaped by the social, political, and cultural norms of a particular time and place.\n5. **Iterative refinement-based definition**: Recognize that definitions are not fixed and may need to be refined or updated over time. This approach involves continuously gathering feedback, refining the definition, and incorporating new insights and perspectives.\n\nTo illustrate these approaches, let's consider the concept of \"harm.\" A consensus-based definition might be developed through a participatory process involving experts, stakeholders, and the general public. An empirical evidence-based definition might be grounded in research on the effects of certain behaviors or actions on individuals or society. A logical analysis-based definition might derive the concept from first principles, identifying the essential characteristics of harm. A historical and cultural context-based definition might consider the evolution of the concept over time and its relationship to social and cultural norms. An iterative refinement-based definition might involve continuously refining the definition based on new evidence and perspectives.\n\nUltimately, establishing a widely accepted, objective definition requires a combination of these approaches, as well as a willingness to engage in ongoing dialogue and refinement. 💡","Here are three summary sentences in English:\n\n* A widely accepted definition can be established through a combination of consensus, empirical evidence, logical analysis, historical context, and iterative refinement.\n* The concept of \"harm\" can be defined through a participatory process involving experts, stakeholders, and the general public, or through research on its effects on individuals and society.\n* A definition is not a fixed entity, but rather a dynamic concept that requires ongoing refinement and adaptation to new evidence and perspectives.\n\nI've selected three words from these sentences and provided their meanings:\n\n1. **Participatory**: (adjective) involving the active participation of people in a process or decision-making activity.\n\nExample: \"The participatory approach to defining the concept of 'harm' involved gathering input from experts, stakeholders, and the general public.\"\n\n2. **Iterative**: (adjective) involving repeated cycles of refinement or improvement.\n\nExample: \"The definition of 'harm' was refined through an iterative process, incorporating new evidence and perspectives at each stage.\"\n\n3. **Dynamic**: (adjective) constantly changing or developing.\n\nExample: \"A definition is a dynamic concept that requires ongoing refinement and adaptation to new evidence and perspectives, rather than a fixed entity.\""],"references":[null,null]}

Alex says, \"The person who ordered the latte is sitting next to the person who ordered the cappuccino.\" Ben says, \"I did not order the espresso.\" Chris says, \"The person who ordered the espresso is sitting next to the person who did not order the latte.\"\n\nWho ordered what, and who is sitting next to whom?\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Alex says, \"The person who ordered the latte is sitting next to the person who ordered the cappuccino.\" This statement tells us that the latte and cappuccino are adjacent to each other.\n2. Ben says, \"I did not order the espresso.\" This statement tells us that Ben did not order the espresso.\n3. Chris says, \"The person who ordered the espresso is sitting next to the person who did not order the latte.\" This statement tells us that the espresso is adjacent to someone who did not order the latte.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n* If Alex ordered the latte, then Ben must have ordered the cappuccino (since Alex said they're adjacent). But then Chris would have to order the espresso, which would mean Chris is sitting next to someone who did not order the latte (Ben). However, Chris said the espresso is sitting next to someone who did not order the latte, which means Chris is not sitting next to Ben. This is a contradiction, so Alex cannot have ordered the latte.\n* If Ben ordered the latte, then Chris must have ordered the cappuccino (since Alex said they're adjacent). But then Alex would have to order the espresso, which would mean Alex is sitting next to someone who did not order the latte (Chris). However, Alex said the person who ordered the latte is sitting next to the person who ordered the cappuccino, which means Alex is not sitting next to Chris.

When you cook rice, the grains absorb water and swell, releasing starches and other compounds that help to create the characteristic texture and consistency of cooked rice.\n\nWhen you cook one cup of rice, the grains have enough space to absorb the water and expand to their full potential. However, when you cook two cups of rice, the grains are packed more tightly together, which means they have less space to absorb water and expand. As a result, the rice may become mushy or sticky if you add too much water.\n\nBy adding less water, you're allowing the grains to absorb the water at a slower rate, which helps to prevent the rice from becoming too mushy or sticky. This is because the grains have more space to expand and release their starches, resulting in a better texture and consistency.\n\nIn general, the ideal water-to-rice ratio for cooking rice is around 1:1.5 to 1:2, which means you should use 1 part rice to 1.5 to 2 parts water. However, this ratio can vary depending on the type of rice you're using, as well as your personal preference for texture and consistency.\n\nSo, to summarize, adding less water when cooking two cups of rice is a way to ensure that the grains have enough space to absorb the water and expand properly, resulting in a better texture and consistency.","🤔\n\nThe amount of water that evaporates during cooking rice is influenced by several factors, including:\n\n1. **Heat**: Higher heat can increase the rate of evaporation, causing more water to evaporate from the rice. This is why it's common to reduce the heat towards the end of cooking to prevent the rice from becoming too dry.\n2. **Cooking time**: Longer cooking times can also increase the amount of water that evaporates, as the rice has more time to absorb and release moisture.\n3. **Rice type**: Different types of rice have varying levels of starch and moisture content, which can affect the amount of water that evaporates during cooking. For example, Japanese short-grain rice tends to absorb more water than long-grain rice.\n4. **Water quality**: The quality of the water used for cooking can also impact the amount of water that evaporates. For example, hard water with high mineral content can cause more water to evaporate than soft water.\n5. **Cooking method**: The cooking method used can also influence the amount of water that evaporates. For example, steaming rice can result in less water evaporation than boiling or pan-frying.\n6. **Atmospheric conditions**: The humidity and temperature of the surrounding environment can also affect the amount of water that evaporates. For example, cooking in a humid environment can reduce the amount of water that evaporates.\n7. **Rice-to-water ratio**: The ratio of rice to water can also impact the amount of water that evaporates. Using too little water can cause the rice to become dry and crispy, while using too much water can result in mushy rice.\n\nBy understanding these factors, you can adjust your cooking techniques and ingredients to achieve the perfect balance of texture and moisture in your cooked rice. 🍚"],"references":["물의 증발량은 라면 1개를 끓일 때와 2개를 끓일 때 거의 같다. 따라서, 라면을 2개를 끓일 때는 1100mL보다 적은 양의 물을 사용해도 된다.",null]}

A brilliant flash of light illuminated the sky, and a young woman, Akira, materialized in the middle of the city. Confused and disoriented, she stumbled through the crowds, trying to make sense of her surroundings.\n\nAkira's memories were hazy, but she recalled being a renowned scientist in the year 2154. She had spent years developing a time travel device, and now, it seemed, she had finally succeeded. But why was she here, in the past?\n\nAs she struggled to find her bearings, Akira noticed a group of teenagers staring at her in awe. One of them, a boy with messy brown hair, approached her cautiously. \"Hey, are you okay? You just appeared out of nowhere!\"\n\nAkira's eyes locked onto the boy, and she felt a spark of recognition. This was Taro, a high school student who would become her closest friend and confidant. But how did she know him?

The possibilities are endless, and I'm excited to see where my journey takes me.","What a great question! As an astronaut living in the future, I'd like to highlight some challenges I face when writing my journal compared to a terrestrial journal:\n\n1. **Distance and Isolation:** As an astronaut, I'm physically separated from my loved ones and the planet I call home. This distance can make it difficult to connect with my emotions and experiences, making it harder to write about them in a meaningful way.\n2. **Unfamiliar Environment:** Living in space, I'm constantly surrounded by the vastness of the universe, which can be overwhelming and disorienting. This unfamiliar environment can make it challenging to find the right words to describe my experiences and emotions.\n3. **Time Dilation:** Due to the effects of relativity, time passes differently for me compared to those on Earth. This can make it difficult to keep track of time and maintain a sense of continuity in my journal.\n4. **Limited Resources:** As an astronaut, I have limited access to resources and equipment, which can make it difficult to write in my journal. For example, I may not have access to a reliable power source, a comfortable writing surface, or even a pen and paper.\n5. **Unpredictable Schedule:** My schedule is constantly changing due to the demands of space travel and exploration. This unpredictability can make it challenging to find the time and mental clarity to write in my journal.\n6. **Lack of Sensory Cues:** In space, I'm deprived of many sensory cues that are familiar to me on Earth, such as the feeling of gravity, the smell of fresh air, or the sound of birds chirping. This can make it difficult to tap into my emotions and experiences.\n7. **Isolation from Human Connection:** As an astronaut, I'm often isolated from human interaction for extended periods. This can make it challenging to find the emotional support and connection I need to write about my experiences in a meaningful way.\n\nDespite these challenges, I find that writing my journal is an essential part of my journey as an astronaut. It helps me process my emotions, reflect on my experiences, and maintain a sense of connection to my humanity."],"references":[null,null]}

Let's imagine how Karl Marx, the author of Das Kapital, would view the recent cryptocurrency boom, particularly Bitcoin, and analyze the modern social issues from his perspective.\n\n**Marx's critique of Bitcoin**\n\nMarx would likely view Bitcoin as a manifestation of the contradictions of capitalism, particularly the fetishization of commodities and the exploitation of labor. He would argue that Bitcoin's value is not based on any inherent worth or utility, but rather on the speculative bubble created by the market. The value of Bitcoin is derived from the collective belief in its value, which is fueled by the hype and speculation of investors.\n\nMarx would also criticize the decentralized and anonymous nature of Bitcoin, arguing that it allows for the concealment of the true owners and controllers of the system, perpetuating the exploitation of labor and the concentration of wealth. He would see the lack of regulation and oversight as a means for the wealthy and powerful to manipulate the market and further entrench their positions.\n\n**The alienation of labor**\n\nMarx would likely argue that the rise of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is a reflection of the alienation of labor in modern society. As people become increasingly disconnected from the physical and social aspects of work, they seek alternative forms of value creation and exchange. The rise of cryptocurrencies allows individuals to participate in the global economy without being tied to traditional employment or geographical locations, but Marx would argue that this freedom is illusory, as it is still based on the exploitation of labor and the accumulation of wealth.\n\n**The fetishization of commodities**\n\nMarx would see the rise of cryptocurrencies as a manifestation of the fetishization of commodities, where the value of a good or service is determined by its market price rather than its use value. He would argue that the value of Bitcoin is not determined by its utility or functionality, but rather by the collective belief in its value, which is driven by speculation and hype.\n\n**The concentration of wealth**\n\nMarx would likely argue that the rise of cryptocurrencies has exacerbated the concentration of wealth, as the early adopters and investors in the market have reaped the majority of the benefits. He would see the concentration of wealth as a result of the inherent contradictions of capitalism, where the means of production are controlled by a small elite, and the majority of the population is left to compete for a shrinking share of the pie.\n\n**The role of ideology**\n\nMarx would likely argue that the rise of cryptocurrencies is also a reflection of the dominant ideology of our time, which emphasizes individualism, competition, and the pursuit of profit. He would see the emphasis on decentralized and anonymous transactions as a reflection of the desire for freedom and autonomy, but also as a means for the powerful to maintain their control and exploit the labor of others.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nFrom Marx's perspective, the rise of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is a reflection of the contradictions of capitalism, the alienation of labor, the fetishization of commodities, and the concentration of wealth. He would likely argue that these phenomena are symptoms of a deeper crisis in the capitalist system, which can only be resolved through the establishment of a socialist society where the means of production are collectively owned and controlled, and the value of goods and services is determined by their use value rather than their market price.","Analyzing modern society's problems from Karl Marx's perspective can be challenging for several reasons:\n\n1. **Limited understanding of modern capitalism**: Marx's work was written in the 19th century, and his understanding of capitalism was based on the industrial capitalism of his time. Modern capitalism has evolved significantly since then, with the rise of globalization, financialization, and digital technologies. Marx's theories may not fully capture the complexities of contemporary capitalism.\n2. **Lack of consideration of non-Western societies**: Marx's work was heavily influenced by European history and society. He may not have fully considered the experiences and perspectives of non-Western societies, which have their own unique historical and cultural contexts.\n3. **Overemphasis on class struggle**: Marx's theory of class struggle is central to his analysis of capitalism. However, modern society is characterized by a more complex and nuanced social structure, with multiple forms of inequality and oppression. Marx's focus on class struggle may not fully capture the diversity of social issues and conflicts.\n4. **Difficulty in applying Marxist concepts to modern phenomena**: Some modern phenomena, such as cryptocurrencies, social media, and artificial intelligence, may not fit neatly into Marx's categories of exploitation and alienation. It can be challenging to apply Marxist concepts to these new forms of social organization and economic activity.\n5. **Critiques of Marx's theory**: Marx's theory has been subject to various critiques and challenges over the years. Some argue that his theory is too deterministic, neglects individual agency, or fails to account for the complexity of human behavior. These critiques can make it difficult to apply Marx's theory to modern society.\n6. **Changes in the nature of work and labor**: Marx's theory was based on the idea of industrial labor and the exploitation of workers in factories. However, the nature of work and labor has changed significantly in recent decades, with the rise of the gig economy, automation, and remote work. Marx's theory may not fully capture the new forms of labor and exploitation that have emerged.\n7. **Difficulty in identifying the ruling class**: Marx's theory relies on the idea of a clear ruling class that exploits the working class. However, in modern society, the ruling class may be more diffuse and complex, with multiple centers of power and influence. Identifying the ruling class and understanding their relationship to the working class can be challenging.\n\nDespite these challenges, many scholars and activists continue to draw on Marx's ideas to analyze and critique modern society. By acknowledging the limitations of Marx's theory and adapting it to the complexities of contemporary society, it is possible to develop a more nuanced understanding of the social and economic issues that we face today."],"references":[null,null]}

It's typically denoted as O(f(n)), where f(n) is a function of the input size n.\n\nIn the context of Git, time complexity can be measured in terms of the number of operations performed, such as:\n\n* Number of commits to merge or rebase\n* Number of files to update\n* Number of conflicts to resolve\n\n**Optimizing Time Complexity**\n\nTo optimize time complexity, we can use various algorithms and techniques to reduce the number of operations required. Here are some examples:\n\n1. **Hash Table Lookups**: When searching for a specific commit or file in a large repository, using a hash table (e.g., `git rev-parse`) can reduce the time complexity from O(n) to O(1), where n is the number of commits or files.\n2. **Binary Search**: When searching for a specific commit or file in a sorted list, using binary search can reduce the time complexity from O(n) to O(log n).\n3. **Caching**: Caching frequently accessed data can reduce the time complexity by avoiding redundant computations. For example, `git` uses caching to store frequently accessed commit hashes.\n4. **Parallel Processing**: When possible, parallelizing tasks can reduce the time complexity by utilizing multiple CPU cores. For example, `git` uses parallel processing to speed up tasks like `git fetch` and `git push`.\n\n**Example: Optimizing Git's `git merge` Algorithm**\n\nThe `git merge` algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of commits to merge. To optimize this, we can use a technique called \"three-way merge\" which reduces the time complexity to O(log n).\n\nHere's a simplified example of how it works:\n\n1. Find the common ancestor commit between the two branches (O(log n))\n2. Create a new merge commit that combines the changes from both branches (O(1))\n3. Update the commit history to reflect the new merge commit (O(1))\n\nBy using three-way merge, we reduce the time complexity from O(n) to O(log n), making the `git merge` algorithm more efficient.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOptimizing time complexity is crucial in Git, as it can significantly impact the performance of various operations. By using algorithms and techniques like hash table lookups, binary search, caching, and parallel processing, we can reduce the time complexity and make Git operations more efficient.","**Space Complexity**\n\nSpace complexity, also known as memory complexity, refers to the amount of memory or storage required by an algorithm or data structure to perform its operations. It's typically denoted as O(f(n)), where f(n) is a function of the input size n.\n\nIn the context of Git, space complexity can be measured in terms of:\n\n* Memory usage: How much memory is required to store the commit history, index, and working directory.\n* Disk space usage: How much disk space is required to store the repository, including the commit history, files, and directories.\n\n**Key differences between Time and Space Complexity**\n\nTime complexity and space complexity are related but distinct concepts:\n\n* Time complexity focuses on the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete, whereas space complexity focuses on the amount of memory or storage required.\n* Time complexity is more relevant for algorithms that perform computations, whereas space complexity is more relevant for algorithms that store or manipulate large amounts of data.\n\n**Example: Git's Space Complexity**\n\nGit's space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of commits in the repository. This means that the amount of memory required to store the commit history grows linearly with the number of commits.\n\nFor example, when you run `git log`, Git needs to store the commit history in memory, which requires a certain amount of memory. As the number of commits increases, the memory required to store the commit history also increases.\n\n**Optimizing Space Complexity**\n\nOptimizing space complexity is important in Git, especially when dealing with large repositories or limited memory resources. Some techniques to optimize space complexity include:\n\n* **Compression**: Compressing data, such as commit history or files, to reduce the amount of memory required.\n* **Caching**: Caching frequently accessed data to reduce the amount of memory required.\n* **Data structures**: Using efficient data structures, such as hash tables or binary trees, to reduce the amount of memory required.\n\nBy understanding and optimizing both time and space complexity, we can improve the performance and efficiency of Git operations."],"references":[null,null]}

{"id":27,"category":"코딩(Coding)","questions":["HTTP\/1.1 및 2의 주요 메서드 5개와 그들의 역할에 대하여 설명해보시오.","HTTP 메서드 중 PUT과 PATCH의 차이는 무엇인가?"],"outputs":["Here are the 5 main HTTP methods in HTTP\/1.1 and HTTP\/2, along with their roles:\n\n**HTTP\/1.1 Methods**\n\n1. **GET**: Retrieves a resource from the server. This is the most common HTTP method, used to request data from a server. For example, when you enter a URL in your browser, a GET request is sent to the server to retrieve the HTML content of the page.\n2. **POST**: Sends data to the server to create a new resource. This method is used to send data to the server, such as when submitting a form or sending a file. The server processes the data and returns a response.\n3. **PUT**: Updates an existing resource on the server. This method is used to update an existing resource, such as updating a user's profile information.\n4. **DELETE**: Deletes a resource from the server. This method is used to delete a resource, such as deleting a user account.\n5. **HEAD**: Retrieves metadata about a resource from the server. This method is similar to GET, but only returns the metadata (e.g., headers) of the resource, without the actual content.\n\n**HTTP\/2 Methods**\n\nIn addition to the above methods, HTTP\/2 introduces two new methods:\n\n1. **CONNECT**: Establishes a tunnel to the server. This method is used to establish a secure connection to the server, such as when using HTTPS.\n2. **PATCH**: Partially updates an existing resource on the server. This method is used to update a specific part of an existing resource, such as updating a specific field in a user's profile.\n\n**Key differences between HTTP\/1.1 and HTTP\/2**\n\n* HTTP\/2 introduces multiplexing, which allows multiple requests to be sent over a single connection, improving performance.\n* HTTP\/2 also introduces header compression, which reduces the overhead of sending headers.\n* HTTP\/2 introduces new methods, such as CONNECT and PATCH, which provide additional functionality.\n\nIn summary, the main HTTP methods in HTTP\/1.1 and HTTP\/2 are:\n\n* GET: Retrieves a resource\n* POST: Creates a new resource\n* PUT: Updates an existing resource\n* DELETE: Deletes a resource\n* HEAD: Retrieves metadata about a resource\n* CONNECT: Establishes a tunnel to the server (HTTP\/2 only)\n* PATCH: Partially updates an existing resource (HTTP\/2 only)\n\nEach method has its own specific role and use case, and understanding these methods is essential for building effective web applications.","PUT and PATCH are both HTTP methods used to modify resources on a server, but they differ in their approach and usage.\n\n**PUT**\n\nPUT is a method that replaces the entire resource with the request body. When you send a PUT request, you're essentially saying, \"Replace the entire resource with this new data.\"\n\nHere are some key characteristics of PUT:\n\n* Replaces the entire resource\n* The request body contains the new data\n* The server is expected to overwrite the existing resource with the new data\n* If the resource doesn't exist, the server may create a new one\n\nExample: Updating a user's profile information using PUT:\n```http\nPUT \/users\/123\n{\n  \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n  \"email\": \"johndoe@example.com\"\n}\n```\n**PATCH**\n\nPATCH is a method that updates a specific part of a resource. When you send a PATCH request, you're saying, \"Update this specific part of the resource with this new data.\"\n\nHere are some key characteristics of PATCH:\n\n* Updates a specific part of the resource\n* The request body contains the changes to be made\n* The server is expected to apply the changes to the existing resource\n* If the resource doesn't exist, the server may create a new one\n\nExample: Updating a user's email address using PATCH:\n```http\nPATCH \/users\/123\n{\n  \"email\": \"jane Doe@example.com\"\n}\n```\nIn summary:\n\n* PUT replaces the entire resource, while PATCH updates a specific part of the resource.\n* PUT is often used for creating or replacing a resource, while PATCH is used for updating a specific field or attribute of an existing resource.\n\nWhen deciding which method to use, consider the following:\n\n* If you need to replace the entire resource, use PUT.\n* If you need to update a specific part of the resource, use PATCH.\n\nIt's worth noting that some APIs may not support both PUT and PATCH, or may have different behaviors for each method. Always check the API documentation to determine the best approach for your specific use case."],"references":["GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, HEAD, TRACE, CONNECT 중 5개를 설명","PUT은 전체를 업데이트하는 반면, PATCH는 일부를 업데이트한다."]}

We iterate through each character in the input list `characters`.\n2. For each character, we check if the count of that character in the list is equal to 1 using the `count()` method.\n3. If the count is 1, it means that the character is unique, so we return that character.\n\nHere are some test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior:\n```\nprint(find_unique_character(['a', 'b', 'c', 'a', 'd']))  # Output: 'b'\nprint(find_unique_character(['a', 'b', 'a', 'b', 'c']))  # Output: 'c'\nprint(find_unique_character(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']))  # Output: 'a'\n```\nNote that this function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input list, because we are iterating through the list once. This is not the most efficient solution, especially for large input lists. A more efficient solution would be to use a set to keep track of unique characters, which would have a time complexity of O(n) in the worst case. Here is an example of how you could implement that:\n```\ndef find_unique_character(characters):\n    unique_chars = set()\n    for char in characters:\n        if char not in unique_chars:\n            unique_chars.add(char)\n        else:\n            return char\n    return None\n```\nThis function uses a set to keep track of unique characters, and returns the first character that is not in the set. If all characters are unique, it returns `None`.","Here are some ways to increase the difficulty of the problem:\n\n1. **Case-insensitive comparison**: Instead of comparing characters exactly, make the comparison case-insensitive. This means that 'A' and 'a' should be considered the same character.\n2. **Non-ASCII characters**: Include non-ASCII characters in the input list, such as accented characters, punctuation, or special characters. This will require the function to handle Unicode characters correctly.\n3. **Empty strings**: Include empty strings in the input list. This will require the function to handle the edge case where an empty string is present.\n4. **Duplicate characters with different cases**: Include characters that are the same but have different cases (e.g., 'A' and 'a'). This will require the function to handle the case where two characters are the same but have different cases.\n5. **Long input lists**: Increase the length of the input list to make the function handle larger inputs. This will require the function to be efficient and scalable.\n6. **Multiple unique characters**: Instead of finding the first unique character, find all unique characters in the list. This will require the function to return a list of unique characters instead of a single character.\n7. **Preserve order**: Instead of returning the first unique character, return the unique characters in the order they appear in the original list.

He claims that deep work is not just a skill, but a superpower that can lead to a more meaningful and fulfilling life.\n\nNewport argues that in today's world, where distractions and shallow work are abundant, the ability to focus and perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare and valuable. He believes that deep work is not just about getting things done quickly and efficiently, but about being fully engaged and immersed in one's work, which can lead to a sense of flow and satisfaction.\n\nTherefore, option C) satisfaction and well-being is the correct answer, as it is the aspect of deep work that Newport emphasizes as a key benefit.","Today's education system can both support and hinder the development of deep work skills in students. Here are some ways in which the system can support and hinder deep work skills:\n\n**Supporting deep work skills:**\n\n1. **Focus on critical thinking and problem-solving**: Many educational institutions emphasize critical thinking and problem-solving skills, which are essential for deep work.\n2. **Encouraging independent learning**: Some schools and teachers encourage students to work independently, allowing them to develop their ability to focus and concentrate.\n3. **Providing resources and tools**: Some schools and teachers provide students with resources and tools that facilitate deep work, such as quiet study spaces, noise-cancelling headphones, or productivity apps.\n4. **Emphasizing quality over quantity**: Some educators prioritize quality over quantity, encouraging students to focus on producing high-quality work rather than rushing to complete tasks quickly.\n\n**Hindering deep work skills:**\n\n1. **Overemphasis on multiple tasks and multitasking**: Many students are expected to juggle multiple tasks and projects simultaneously, which can make it difficult to focus on a single task and develop deep work skills.\n2. **Distracting learning environments**: Many classrooms and learning environments are designed to be noisy and distracting, making it difficult for students to focus.\n3. **Lack of structure and accountability**: Without clear goals, deadlines, and accountability, students may struggle to stay focused and motivated.\n4. **Overreliance on technology**: While technology can be a useful tool for deep work, excessive use of social media, email, and other digital distractions can hinder students' ability to focus.\n5. **Assessment and evaluation methods**: Some assessment and evaluation methods, such as multiple-choice tests and quizzes, may not accurately measure students' ability to think critically and work deeply.\n6. **Teacher-student interactions**: Frequent interruptions and constant feedback from teachers can disrupt students' ability to focus and work deeply.\n7. **Lack of breaks and self-care**: Students may not have enough time for breaks and self-care, leading to burnout and decreased ability to focus.\n\nTo support deep work skills, educators can consider implementing strategies such as:\n\n* Providing quiet, distraction-free spaces for students to work\n* Encouraging students to set goals and deadlines for themselves\n* Fostering a culture of focus and concentration\n* Teaching time management and prioritization skills\n* Encouraging students to take regular breaks and practice self-care\n* Using technology to facilitate deep work, such as productivity apps and noise-cancelling headphones."],"references":["B",null]}

For example, \"사과하다\" (sa-gwa-ha-da) means \"to apologize\" or \"to express regret.\"\n\nSo, if someone says \"사과해!\" (sa-gwa-hae!), it means \"Apologize!\" or \"Sorry!\" 😊","😊\n\nIn linguistics, \"동음이의어\" (dong-eum-i-eui-eo) and \"다의어\" (da-ui-eo) are two related but distinct concepts.\n\n**동음이의어 (Homophone Homograph)**\n\n* A homophone homograph is a word that is pronounced the same as another word, but has a different meaning and often a different spelling.\n* Examples:\n\t+ \"to\" (in \"to go\") and \"two\" (the number 2)\n\t+ \"knight\" (a medieval warrior) and \"night\" (the time of day)\n\t+ \"bare\" (without clothing) and \"bear\" (the animal)\n\nIn Korean, examples of homophone homographs include:\n\n\t+ (ne) meaning \"to be\" and (ne) meaning \"and\"\n\t+ (yeo) meaning \"to go\" and (yeo) meaning \"to know\"\n\n**다의어 (Polyseme)**\n\n* A polyseme is a word that has multiple related meanings, often with a common core or underlying concept.\n* Examples:\n\t+ \"bank\" (a financial institution) and \"bank\" (the side of a river)\n\t+ \"head\" (the top of the body) and \"head\" (a leader or chief)\n\t+ \"spring\" (a season) and \"spring\" (a coiled metal object that stores energy)\n\nIn Korean, examples of polysemes include:\n\n\t+ (jeo) meaning \"to know\" and \"to understand\", but also \"to recognize\" or \"to acknowledge\"\n\t+ (eol) meaning \"to go\" and \"to move\", but also \"to depart\" or \"to leave\"\n\nIn summary:\n\n* Homophone homographs are words that are pronounced the same but have different meanings and often different spellings.\n* Polysemes are words that have multiple related meanings, often with a common core or underlying concept.\n\nI hope this helps clarify the difference! 😊"],"references":["아래 뜻 중 두 가지 이상 언급했으면 정답으로 인정.\n1. 자기의 잘못을 인정하고 용서를 빎. 2.

The sentence \"나는 그런 아름다움을 모른다.\" means that the speaker does not know about that beauty. The word \"그러나\" (however) is used to contrast the two ideas, indicating that the speaker does not share the same opinion as others. Therefore, the correct answer is \"그러나\".\n\nHere's a breakdown of the other options:\n\n1. \"그래서\" (so) would imply a cause-and-effect relationship between the two sentences, which is not the case here.\n3. \"그리고\" (and) would imply a conjunction between the two sentences, which is not the correct relationship.\n4. \"따라서\" (therefore) would imply a conclusion or a logical consequence, which is not the case here.\n\nThe correct sentence would be:\n\n이 세상에는 아름다운 것들이 참으로 많다고들 한다. 그러나 나는 그런 아름다움을 모른다.","😊\n\n\"그러나\" (however) is a contrastive conjunction that indicates a contrast or a difference between two ideas or statements. Some other Korean conjunctions that have similar roles are:\n\n1. **하지만** (but): This is a stronger contrastive conjunction than \"그러나\", implying a more significant difference or opposition between the two ideas.\nExample: 이 세상에는 아름다운 것들이 많지만 나는 그것을 모른다. (There are many beautiful things in the world, but I don't know about them.)\n2. **에도** (even though) or **에도 불구하고** (despite): These conjunctions indicate a contrast between two ideas, but with a sense of inevitability or necessity.\nExample: 나는 공부를 열심히 하지만에도 불구하고 시험에 실패했다. (I studied hard, even though I failed the exam.)\n3. **아니면** (or) **아니면도** (or): These conjunctions indicate a choice or an alternative between two ideas.\nExample: 나는 이 책을 읽을지 아니면 다른 책을 읽을지 결정해야 한다. (I have to decide whether to read this book or another one.)\n4. **이나** (or) **이나도** (or): These conjunctions indicate a choice or an alternative between two ideas, with a sense of equivalence or similarity between the two options.\nExample: 나는 이 도시나 다른 도시에서 살 수 있습니다. (I can live in this city or another one.)\n\nThese conjunctions all serve to connect two ideas or statements, but with different nuances and connotations. \"그러나\" is a good choice when you want to indicate a contrast or a difference between two ideas, while the other conjunctions can be used in different contexts to convey different shades of meaning. 😊"],"references":["2. 그러나",null]}

[길가]에 개나리가 만개했다. - '길가' is a noun, not a verb, so it doesn't need to be pronounced as a verb.\n2. 너희들이 그 모양이니 [발전]이 없는 거야. - '발전' is a verb, and it's pronounced as a verb, not a noun.\n3.

It occurs when a nasal consonant (such as ㄱ, ㄷ, or ㅂ) is followed by a vowel, causing the vowel to be pronounced with a nasalized quality.\n\nIn the case of the word \"쫓는\" (chad-neun), the final consonant \"ㄷ\" is a nasal consonant, and it has an influence on the preceding vowel \"ㅏ\" (a). As a result, the vowel \"ㅏ\" is pronounced with a nasalized quality, and the word \"쫓는\" is pronounced as \"chad-neuun\" (with a nasalized \"u\" sound).\n\nSo, the correct pronunciation of \"쫓는\" is indeed \"chad-neuun\", with a nasalized \"u\" sound.","You're asking about the phenomenon where the consonant \"ㄹ\" is pronounced as \"ㄴ\" when it appears between two vowels. This is indeed a common phenomenon in Korean, and it's called \"탈락\" (tal-rak).\n\nIn Korean, when a consonant \"ㄹ\" appears between two vowels, it tends to be pronounced as \"ㄴ\" (the \"n\" sound). This is because the \"ㄹ\" consonant is a liquid consonant, and it can easily change its pronunciation to \"ㄴ\" when it's surrounded by vowels.\n\nSo, the correct pronunciation of \"칼날\" (kal-nal) is indeed \"kal-nal\", with the \"ㄹ\" consonant pronounced as \"ㄴ\"."],"references":["쫀는","유음화"]}
