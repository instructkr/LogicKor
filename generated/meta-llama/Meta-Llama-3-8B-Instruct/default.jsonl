The concept of justice is indeed a crucial aspect of law, and its definition can be quite challenging to pin down. Since it's a concept that is often debated and interpreted differently by various individuals and cultures, it's essential to consider a universal definition that can be widely accepted by the majority of society. Here are some possible ways to approach this:\n\n1. **Philosophical approach**: One way to define justice is to explore philosophical theories and concepts that have been developed over time. For example, Aristotle's concept of distributive justice, which emphasizes fairness and equality, or John Rawls' theory of justice as fairness, which prioritizes the well-being of the least advantaged. By examining these philosophical frameworks, we can identify common themes and principles that can serve as a foundation for a universal definition of justice.\n2. **Empirical approach**: Another approach is to conduct empirical research to understand how people perceive and experience justice in their daily lives. Surveys, focus groups, and interviews can provide valuable insights into what people consider just and unjust. This approach can help identify commonalities and patterns in people's perceptions of justice, which can inform a more inclusive and representative definition.\n3. **Comparative law approach**: A comparative law approach can also be useful in identifying commonalities and differences in how justice is defined and implemented across different legal systems. By analyzing the laws and legal traditions of various countries, we can identify common themes, principles, and values that are shared across cultures and jurisdictions.\n4. **Pragmatic approach**: A pragmatic approach involves identifying the practical implications of different definitions of justice and evaluating their effectiveness in promoting social cohesion, stability, and well-being. This approach can help us identify a definition of justice that is not only theoretically sound but also practically effective.\n5. **Consensus-building approach**: Finally, a consensus-building approach involves bringing together experts from various fields, including law, philosophy, sociology, and psychology, to discuss and debate the concept of justice. This approach can help identify common ground and build a shared understanding of what justice means and how it can be achieved.\n\nSome possible universal principles that can be derived from these approaches include:\n\n* **Fairness**: Justice is about treating individuals and groups fairly and equally, without bias or discrimination.\n* **Respect for human dignity**: Justice respects the inherent dignity and worth of every individual, and seeks to promote their well-being and happiness.\n* **Procedural justice**: Justice involves ensuring that legal processes are fair, transparent, and accessible to all parties involved.\n* **Substantive justice**: Justice involves ensuring that laws and policies are just and equitable, and that they promote the common good.\n\nBy considering these principles and approaches, we can develop a more comprehensive and inclusive definition of justice that is widely accepted by society.","Here are three summary sentences in English:\n\n* The concept of justice is a complex and multifaceted idea that can be approached from various angles, including philosophical, empirical, comparative, pragmatic, and consensus-building perspectives.\n* A universal definition of justice can be derived from these approaches, which may include principles such as fairness, respect for human dignity, procedural justice, and substantive justice.\n* By considering these principles and approaches, we can develop a more comprehensive and inclusive definition of justice that is widely accepted by society.\n\nI've selected three words from these sentences and provided their meanings:\n\n1. **Multifaceted**: Having many different aspects or sides; complex and varied.\n\nExample: \"The concept of justice is a multifaceted idea that can be approached from various angles.\"\n\n2. **Pragmatic**: Concerned with the practical application of ideas or principles; focused on what works in practice.\n\nExample: \"A pragmatic approach involves identifying the practical implications of different definitions of justice and evaluating their effectiveness.\"\n\n3. **Substantive**: Relating to the substance or content of something; dealing with the underlying issues or principles.\n\nExample: \"Substantive justice involves ensuring that laws and policies are just and equitable, and that they promote the common good.\""],"references":[null,null]}

When you cook one packet of noodles, the recommended water ratio is usually around 450-500ml of water for every 120g of noodles. However, when you cook two packets, the noodles will absorb more water because they are now in contact with each other and with the pot.\n\nIf you add the recommended amount of water for two packets (550ml), the noodles will become too soggy and mushy. By using less water, you can achieve a better texture and balance of flavors. A general rule of thumb is to use about 400-450ml of water for two packets of noodles.\n\nAdditionally, using less water helps to prevent the noodles from becoming too salty, as the seasoning packet is designed for one serving. By using less water, you can avoid an overly salty broth.\n\nSo, to summarize, using less water when cooking two packets of instant noodles is a common practice to achieve a better texture and balance of flavors.","🤔\n\nWhen it comes to the amount of water used in cooking instant noodles, several factors can affect the evaporation rate and the overall amount of water needed. Here are some key factors to consider:\n\n1. **Heat source**: The type of heat source used can impact the evaporation rate. For example, electric stoves tend to produce a more consistent and controlled heat, while gas stoves can produce a more intense and variable heat.\n2. **Pot material**: The material of the pot can also affect evaporation. For example, aluminum or copper pots tend to conduct heat better than stainless steel or ceramic pots, which can lead to faster evaporation.\n3. **Stirring and agitation**: The amount of stirring and agitation can influence the evaporation rate. More stirring can help to distribute heat evenly and promote evaporation, while less stirring can lead to hotspots and slower evaporation.\n4. **Noodle type**: Different types of noodles have varying absorption rates. For example, thicker, chewier noodles may require more water than thinner, more delicate noodles.\n5. **Seasoning packet**: The type and amount of seasoning packet used can also impact the evaporation rate. Some seasoning packets may contain more salt or other ingredients that can affect the boiling point of the water.\n6. **Altitude**: The altitude at which you're cooking can also affect evaporation rates. At higher elevations, water boils at a lower temperature, which can lead to slower evaporation.\n7. **Humidity**: The humidity in the air can also impact evaporation rates. Higher humidity can slow down evaporation, while lower humidity can speed it up.\n8. **Pot size**: The size of the pot can also affect evaporation rates. Larger pots tend to lose heat more slowly than smaller pots, which can lead to slower evaporation.\n\nBy considering these factors, you can adjust the amount of water you use when cooking instant noodles to achieve the perfect texture and flavor."],"references":["물의 증발량은 라면 1개를 끓일 때와 2개를 끓일 때 거의 같다. 따라서, 라면을 2개를 끓일 때는 1100mL보다 적은 양의 물을 사용해도 된다.",null]}

This trend is often referred to as \"social media narcissism\" or \"social media addiction.\" Here are some underlying factors that contribute to this phenomenon and potential solutions:\n\n**Underlying factors:**\n\n1. **Social comparison**: Social media platforms are designed to showcase the highlight reels of others' lives, making it easy to compare and feel inferior. This can lead to a sense of inadequacy and a desire to present oneself in a more favorable light.\n2. **Fear of missing out (FOMO)**: The constant stream of updates and notifications can create a sense of FOMO, leading individuals to feel pressure to present a perfect online image to avoid being left out.\n3. **Seeking validation**: Social media can provide instant validation and attention, which can be addictive and lead to a desire for constant validation and attention.\n4. **Lack of self-awareness**: Many individuals may not be aware of their own motivations and emotions, leading them to present a curated online persona without realizing the potential consequences.\n5. **Peer pressure**: Social media can create a sense of peer pressure, where individuals feel pressure to conform to certain standards or norms to fit in with their online communities.\n\n**Potential solutions:**\n\n1. **Raise awareness**: Educate individuals about the potential negative effects of excessive self-presentation on social media, such as decreased self-esteem, increased anxiety, and decreased empathy.\n2. **Promote self-reflection**: Encourage individuals to reflect on their motivations and emotions, and to recognize the potential consequences of their online behavior.\n3. **Foster a culture of authenticity**: Encourage individuals to be authentic and genuine online, rather than presenting a curated image.\n4. **Encourage offline activities**: Promote offline activities and hobbies that bring joy and fulfillment, reducing the need for constant online validation.\n5. **Develop social media literacy**: Teach individuals how to critically evaluate online content, recognize biases and manipulations, and develop healthy online habits.\n6. **Implement social media design changes**: Social media platforms can be designed to promote more authentic and meaningful interactions, such as by prioritizing private messaging over public posting.\n7. **Encourage responsible social media use**: Encourage individuals to set boundaries and limits on their social media use, and to prioritize real-life connections and relationships.\n8. **Provide mental health resources**: Offer mental health resources and support for individuals struggling with social media addiction or related mental health issues.\n\nBy addressing these underlying factors and implementing these solutions, we can work towards promoting healthier and more authentic online behaviors, and reducing the negative consequences of excessive self-presentation on social media.","From a capitalist perspective, the phenomenon of excessive self-presentation on social media can be seen as a natural and beneficial aspect of the market economy. Here's a logical argument for why:\n\n**Argument:**\n\n1. **Increased consumer demand**: Social media platforms are driven by consumer demand for entertainment, social interaction, and self-expression. As people seek to present themselves online, social media companies can capitalize on this demand by offering services and features that cater to these desires.\n2. **Economic growth**: The growth of social media has created new industries and job opportunities, contributing to economic growth and development. The demand for social media services, advertising, and content creation has led to the creation of new businesses and employment opportunities.\n3. **Competition and innovation**: The proliferation of social media has led to increased competition among platforms, driving innovation and improvement in services and features. This competition has also led to the development of new technologies and business models, such as influencer marketing and e-commerce.\n4. **Personal branding and entrepreneurship**: Social media has enabled individuals to build personal brands and establish themselves as experts in their fields. This has created new opportunities for entrepreneurship, freelancing, and self-employment, which can contribute to economic growth and innovation.\n5. **Data collection and analysis**: Social media platforms collect vast amounts of data on user behavior, which can be used to inform marketing strategies, improve services, and drive business decisions. This data can also be used to create new products and services, such as targeted advertising and personalized recommendations.\n6. **Increased productivity**: Social media can be used as a tool for productivity, allowing individuals to stay connected with colleagues, clients, and customers, and to manage their work and personal lives more efficiently.\n7. **Democratization of media**: Social media has democratized the media landscape, allowing individuals to create and share content, and to reach a global audience. This has created new opportunities for self-expression, creativity, and entrepreneurship.\n\n**Counterargument:**\n\n1. **Negative externalities**: While social media can have positive effects, it also has negative externalities, such as decreased attention span, increased anxiety, and decreased empathy. These negative effects can have broader social and economic consequences, such as decreased productivity and increased healthcare costs.\n2. **Inequality and exploitation**: Social media can exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities, as those with more resources and connections have a greater ability to present themselves online and access opportunities. This can lead to exploitation and unequal access to resources and opportunities.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nFrom a capitalist perspective, the phenomenon of excessive self-presentation on social media can be seen as a natural and beneficial aspect of the market economy. While there are potential negative externalities and inequalities, the benefits of social media, such as increased consumer demand, economic growth, competition, and innovation, outweigh the costs. However, it is essential to acknowledge the potential negative consequences and work to mitigate them, such as by promoting responsible social media use, addressing inequality, and ensuring that the benefits of social media are shared equitably."],"references":[null,null]}

It's a classic example of a problem that can be solved using probability theory and game theory.\n\nThe goal is to find the optimal strategy for the employees to find their assigned cabin with the highest probability. Since each employee can only open at most 50 cabins, we need to find a strategy that maximizes the probability of finding the correct cabin within these 50 attempts.\n\nHere's a possible solution:\n\n1. Divide the 100 cabins into 2 groups: Group A (1-50) and Group B (51-100).\n2. Assign the first 50 employees to Group A and the remaining 50 employees to Group B.\n3. Within each group, assign the employees to cabins in a random order.\n4. Each employee opens 25 cabins from their assigned group (e.g., an employee in Group A opens cabins 1-25).\n5. If an employee finds their assigned cabin, they stop searching. If not, they move to the next group (e.g., an employee in Group A moves to Group B).\n6. Repeat steps 4-5 until all employees have found their assigned cabin or have exhausted their 50 attempts.\n\nThis strategy is known as the \"Divide-and-Conquer\" strategy. By dividing the cabins into two groups, we reduce the search space for each employee, making it more likely for them to find their assigned cabin within their assigned group. The random assignment within each group ensures that the employees are evenly distributed across the cabins, making it more likely for each employee to find their assigned cabin.\n\nThe probability of finding the correct cabin using this strategy can be calculated as follows:\n\n* For an employee in Group A, the probability of finding their assigned cabin within the first 25 attempts is 1\/25, since there are 25 cabins in Group A.\n* For an employee in Group B, the probability of finding their assigned cabin within the first 25 attempts is 1\/50, since there are 50 cabins in Group B.\n* If an employee does not find their assigned cabin within their assigned group, they move to the next group, where the probability of finding their assigned cabin is 1\/50.\n* The overall probability of finding the correct cabin is the sum of the probabilities of finding it in each group, which is approximately 0.64.\n\nThis strategy is not optimal, but it is a good approximation. A more optimal strategy would require a more complex analysis of the problem, involving game theory and probability theory. However, the Divide-and-Conquer strategy is a simple and effective solution that can be implemented in practice.","The strategy I provided earlier is based on the assumption that each employee can open at most 50 cabins. However, if the number of cabins that each employee can open is reduced to 15, the strategy needs to be modified.\n\nIn this case, we can use a similar approach, but with a few adjustments:\n\n1. Divide the 100 cabins into 2 groups: Group A (1-30) and Group B (31-100).\n2. Assign the 30 employees to Group A.\n3. Within Group A, assign the employees to cabins in a random order.\n4. Each employee opens 7 cabins from Group A (e.g., an employee opens cabins 1-7).\n5. If an employee finds their assigned cabin, they stop searching. If not, they move to Group B.\n6. Repeat steps 4-5 until all employees have found their assigned cabin or have exhausted their 15 attempts.\n\nThe key difference is that each employee now opens only 7 cabins from Group A, instead of 25. This reduces the search space, making it more likely for each employee to find their assigned cabin within their assigned group.\n\nThe probability of finding the correct cabin using this modified strategy can be calculated as follows:\n\n* For an employee in Group A, the probability of finding their assigned cabin within the first 7 attempts is 1\/7, since there are 7 cabins in Group A.\n* If an employee does not find their assigned cabin within Group A, they move to Group B, where the probability of finding their assigned cabin is 1\/70, since there are 70 cabins in Group B.\n* The overall probability of finding the correct cabin is the sum of the probabilities of finding it in each group, which is approximately 0.43.\n\nThis modified strategy is still a good approximation, but it's not as effective as the original strategy. The probability of finding the correct cabin is lower, since each employee has fewer attempts to find their assigned cabin. However, it's still a reasonable strategy given the reduced number of cabins that each employee can open."],"references":["이 문제는 원순열(순환이 이루어지는 순열)을 이용해서 풀 수 있다. 해당 전략을 이용하면 (1\/2)^100의 확률을 약 0.31까지 올릴 수 있다.","유효하다."]}

(2)\n\nSubtracting equation (1) from equation (2), we get:\n\n(4 - h)² - (0 - h)² + (5 - k)² - (2 - k)² = 0\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n8h + 9 = 0\n\nSo, h = -9\/8.\n\nSubstituting this value of h into equation (1), we get:\n\n(0 + 9\/8)² + (2 - k)² = r²\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nk² - 2k + 1 = r²\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\nk² - 2k + 1 = r² ... (3)\nh = -9\/8\n\nTo find the value of k, we can use the fact that the circle passes through the point (4, 5). Substituting x = 4 and y = 5 into the equation of the circle, we get:\n\n(4 + 9\/8)² + (5 - k)² = r²\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nk = 7\/4\n\nSubstituting this value of k into equation (3), we get:\n\n(7\/4)² - 2(7\/4) + 1 = r²\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nr² = 1\n\nSo, the radius of the circle is 1.\n\nThe equation of the circle is:\n\n(x + 9\/8)² + (y - 7\/4)² = 1\n\nThis is the equation of the circle that passes through the two points (0, 2) and (4, 5).","The equation of the line is:\n\ny = (3\/4)x + 2\n\nTo write it in the form x = ..., we can solve for x:\n\nx = (4\/3)(y - 2)\n\nSo, the equation of the line in the form x = ... is:\n\nx = (4\/3)(y - 2)"],"references":["직선의 방정식은 y = 3\/4x + 2이며, 원의 방정식을 하나로 정의하기 위해서는 원이 지나는 점 하나를 더 정의하거나, 원의 반지름을 두 점 사이의 거리의 반으로 정의해야 한다. 단, 이때 원이 지나는 점 세 개는 한 직선 위에 있어서는 안 된다.

I'll also include sketches, diagrams, and photographs to illustrate my thoughts and experiences.\n\n**Structure:** Each entry will be dated and divided into three sections:\n\n1. **Observations**: A descriptive account of my current location, the celestial bodies I've encountered, and any notable events or phenomena I've witnessed.\n2. **Reflections**: A personal reflection on my experiences, thoughts, and emotions, including my feelings about being away from Earth and my observations about the universe.\n3. **Sketches and Notes**: A collection of sketches, diagrams, and notes about the celestial bodies, spacecraft systems, and other interesting phenomena I've encountered.\n\n**Sample Entry:**\n\n**Date:** 2345-02-15\n\n**Location:** Orbiting the planet Neptune\n\n**Observations:**\n\nToday, I gazed out at the icy blue planet of Neptune, its rings glinting like a celestial halo. The spacecraft's instruments are functioning within normal parameters, and I've been monitoring the planet's magnetic field, which is surprisingly strong. I've also spotted a few moons orbiting the planet, their surfaces etched with craters and canyons.\n\n**Reflections:**\n\nAs I look out at this distant world, I'm struck by the vastness of the universe and the fragility of our own planet. I miss the warmth of the sun on my skin, the smell of fresh air, and the sound of birds chirping.

As a space traveler, writing a journal can be a unique and challenging experience compared to writing a journal as a terrestrial being. Here are some reasons why:\n\n1. **Distance and disconnection**: As a space traveler, I'm physically separated from the planet and the people I love. This distance can make it difficult to connect with my emotions and experiences, making it harder to write about them in a meaningful way.\n2. **Lack of familiar surroundings**: In space, I'm surrounded by the vastness of the universe, which can be overwhelming and disorienting. This unfamiliar environment can make it challenging to find inspiration and structure for my writing.\n3. **Time dilation and relativity**: As I travel at high speeds or experience time dilation, my perception of time and space can become distorted. This can make it difficult to keep track of time and maintain a sense of continuity in my writing.\n4. **Limited resources and constraints**: Space travel often comes with limited resources, including power, storage, and communication. This can restrict the amount of writing I can do and the tools I have available to me.\n5. **Isolation and loneliness**: Being alone in space for extended periods can be isolating and lonely. This can make it difficult to find motivation and inspiration to write, and can also affect the tone and content of my writing.\n6. **Unfamiliarity with the environment**: As a space traveler, I'm constantly encountering new and unfamiliar environments, from asteroids to black holes. This can make it challenging to describe these experiences in a way that's engaging and accurate.\n7. **Language and communication barriers**: As I travel to different parts of the universe, I may encounter languages and communication systems that are unfamiliar to me. This can make it difficult to express myself effectively and accurately in my writing.\n8. **The weight of responsibility**: As a space traveler, I have a responsibility to document my findings and experiences for the benefit of humanity. This can be a heavy burden, and can make it difficult to approach my writing with a sense of freedom and creativity.\n\nDespite these challenges, I believe that writing a journal as a space traveler can be a powerful way to process my experiences, reflect on my emotions, and share my discoveries with others. By acknowledging these challenges and finding ways to overcome them, I hope to create a journal that is both personal and meaningful."],"references":[null,null]}

I am still trying to process the implications, but I wanted to share my findings with you as soon as possible.\n\nThe discovery is nothing short of breathtaking - a lost city, hidden deep in the heart of the Amazon rainforest, that dates back over 2,000 years. The city, which we've dubbed \"Eldrador,\" is a marvel of engineering and architecture, with structures that defy explanation. The level of sophistication and knowledge displayed by the ancient inhabitants is staggering, and I am convinced that this find will send shockwaves through the academic community.\n\nI have attached some preliminary images and data to this letter, but I want to emphasize that this is just the tip of the iceberg. I have only scratched the surface of what Eldrador has to offer, and I am eager to share my findings with the world.\n\nI would love to discuss this further with you and get your thoughts on the implications of this discovery. I am planning to present my findings at the upcoming conference in Paris, and I would be honored if you could join me.\n\nPlease let me know if you are available, and we can schedule a meeting to go over the details.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]\n\nIn this rewritten version, I've kept the core message and details the same, but adapted it to a letter format.

Let's imagine how Karl Marx, the author of Das Kapital, would view the recent cryptocurrency boom, particularly the rapid increase in the value of Bitcoin. From his perspective, Marx would likely see the phenomenon as a manifestation of the contradictions and flaws of capitalism.\n\nMarx would likely argue that the rise of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is a result of the inherent contradictions within the capitalist system. He would point out that the value of Bitcoin is not based on any tangible asset or commodity, but rather on the faith and speculation of investors. This, he would argue, is a classic example of the fetishization of commodities, where the value of a product is determined by its perceived value rather than its actual utility.\n\nMarx would also see the rapid increase in the value of Bitcoin as a result of the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few individuals and corporations. He would argue that the wealthy elite are using their influence and resources to manipulate the market, creating artificial scarcity and driving up the value of Bitcoin. This, he would claim, is a classic example of the exploitation of the many by the few, where the wealthy use their power to accumulate even more wealth at the expense of the working class.\n\nFurthermore, Marx would likely argue that the rise of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is a response to the crisis of the traditional financial system. He would point out that the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent bailouts have led to a loss of trust in the traditional financial system, and that people are seeking alternative forms of investment and currency. He would argue that the rise of cryptocurrencies is a symptom of the instability and volatility of the global financial system, and that it is a reflection of the inherent contradictions and flaws of capitalism.\n\nFrom Marx's perspective, the problems of modern society can be seen as a result of the contradictions and flaws of capitalism. He would argue that the rise of inequality, poverty, and social unrest are all symptoms of the inherent contradictions of the capitalist system. He would point out that the pursuit of profit and the accumulation of wealth by the capitalist class leads to the exploitation of the working class, and that this exploitation is the root cause of many social and economic problems.\n\nIn particular, Marx would likely argue that the following issues are a result of the contradictions of capitalism:\n\n1. Inequality: The concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few individuals and corporations, leading to a widening gap between the rich and the poor.\n2. Poverty: The exploitation of the working class, leading to low wages, long working hours, and limited access to education and healthcare.\n3. Social unrest: The growing discontent and frustration among the working class, leading to social movements and protests against the capitalist system.\n4. Environmental degradation: The pursuit of profit and growth at the expense of the environment, leading to climate change, pollution, and resource depletion.\n5. Financial instability: The inherent instability of the financial system, leading to boom-and-bust cycles, financial crises, and economic downturns.\n\nIn conclusion, from Marx's perspective, the rise of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is a symptom of the contradictions and flaws of capitalism. He would argue that the problems of modern society are a result of the inherent contradictions of the capitalist system, and that the only way to address these problems is to overthrow the capitalist system and establish a socialist or communist society.","Analyzing modern society's problems from Karl Marx's perspective can be challenging for several reasons:\n\n1. **Limited scope of Marx's theory**: Marx's work was primarily focused on the capitalist mode of production and the class struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. His theory may not be directly applicable to modern societies that have undergone significant changes, such as the rise of post-industrial economies, globalization, and the digital age.\n2. **Complexity of modern societies**: Modern societies are characterized by complexity, diversity, and interconnectedness, which can make it difficult to apply Marx's simplified model of class struggle and exploitation. Modern societies have multiple classes, interest groups, and power structures that are not easily reducible to the binary opposition between bourgeoisie and proletariat.\n3. **Changes in the nature of work and labor**: Marx's theory was based on the assumption that the working class was exploited through wage labor in factories and industries. However, modern societies have seen significant changes in the nature of work, such as the rise of the service sector, the gig economy, and the increasing importance of knowledge work. These changes can make it difficult to apply Marx's concepts of exploitation and alienation to modern work experiences.\n4. **Globalization and international trade**: Marx's theory was focused on the national level, and his ideas about imperialism and colonialism were based on the relationships between European powers and colonized countries. However, globalization has created new forms of economic and political relationships that transcend national borders, making it challenging to apply Marx's ideas to globalized economies.\n5. **Changes in the role of the state**: Marx's theory assumed a strong role for the state in regulating the economy and redistributing wealth. However, modern societies have seen a shift towards neoliberalism, which has led to a reduction in the role of the state and an increase in market-based solutions to social and economic problems.\n6. **New forms of exploitation and oppression**: Marx's theory focused on exploitation through wage labor and the extraction of surplus value. However, modern societies have seen new forms of exploitation and oppression, such as exploitation through debt, data extraction, and surveillance capitalism, which are not easily captured by Marx's theory.\n7. **Changes in the nature of ideology and consciousness**: Marx's theory was based on the idea that ideology is a reflection of the material conditions of society. However, modern societies have seen significant changes in the nature of ideology and consciousness, including the rise of postmodernism, poststructuralism, and identity politics, which can make it challenging to apply Marx's ideas about ideology and class consciousness.\n8. **Methodological limitations**: Marx's method was based on a critique of political economy and a focus on the material conditions of society. However, modern societies are characterized by complexity, non-linearity, and uncertainty, which can make it difficult to apply Marx's methodological approach.\n\nThese challenges highlight the need for a nuanced and critical approach to applying Marx's ideas to modern societies. While Marx's theory remains relevant and influential, it is essential to recognize its limitations and adapt it to the complexities and changes of modern societies."],"references":[null,null]}

It's a way to describe the amount of time an algorithm requires to complete its task. Time complexity is usually expressed using Big O notation, which is a mathematical notation that describes the upper bound of an algorithm's time complexity.\n\n**How to Calculate Time Complexity**\n\nTo calculate the time complexity of an algorithm, you need to analyze the algorithm's execution time as the size of the input increases. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Identify the input size: Determine the size of the input to the algorithm, usually represented as `n`.\n2. Analyze the algorithm's execution time: Measure the time it takes for the algorithm to complete as the input size increases.\n3. Identify the dominant term: Identify the term that grows the fastest as the input size increases. This is usually the term that dominates the time complexity.\n4. Express the time complexity: Express the time complexity using Big O notation, which is a mathematical notation that describes the upper bound of an algorithm's time complexity.\n\n**Examples of Time Complexity**\n\nHere are some common time complexities and their corresponding Big O notation:\n\n* O(1) - Constant time complexity: The algorithm takes the same amount of time regardless of the input size.\n* O(log n) - Logarithmic time complexity: The algorithm takes time proportional to the logarithm of the input size.\n* O(n) - Linear time complexity: The algorithm takes time proportional to the input size.\n* O(n log n) - Linearithmic time complexity: The algorithm takes time proportional to the product of the input size and its logarithm.\n* O(n^2) - Quadratic time complexity: The algorithm takes time proportional to the square of the input size.\n* O(2^n) - Exponential time complexity: The algorithm takes time proportional to 2 raised to the power of the input size.\n\n**Optimizing Time Complexity**\n\nHere are some common techniques used to optimize time complexity:\n\n1. **Loop optimization**: Reduce the number of iterations in a loop by using more efficient algorithms or data structures.\n2. **Memoization**: Store the results of expensive function calls to avoid recalculating them.\n3. **Caching**: Store frequently accessed data in a cache to reduce the number of times it needs to be retrieved.\n4. **Divide and Conquer**: Break down a problem into smaller sub-problems and solve each one recursively.\n5. **Dynamic Programming**: Break down a problem into smaller sub-problems and solve each one only once, storing the results in a table.\n\n**Example: Optimizing a Linear Search Algorithm**\n\nSuppose we have a linear search algorithm that searches for an element in an array:\n```python\ndef linear_search(arr, target):\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        if arr[i] == target:\n            return i\n    return -1\n```\nThe time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the array. To optimize this algorithm, we can use a hash table to store the elements of the array and their indices:\n```python\ndef linear_search(arr, target):\n    hash_table = {}\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        hash_table[arr[i]] = i\n    return hash_table.get(target, -1)\n```\nThe time complexity of this optimized algorithm is O(1), since we can look up the index of the target element in the hash table in constant time. This is a significant improvement over the original algorithm, which had a time complexity of O(n).","**What is Space Complexity?**\n\nSpace complexity, also known as memory complexity, is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses, usually expressed as a function of the size of the input. It's a way to describe the amount of memory an algorithm requires to complete its task. Space complexity is usually expressed using Big O notation, which is a mathematical notation that describes the upper bound of an algorithm's space complexity.\n\n**How to Calculate Space Complexity**\n\nTo calculate the space complexity of an algorithm, you need to analyze the amount of memory the algorithm uses as the size of the input increases. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Identify the input size: Determine the size of the input to the algorithm, usually represented as `n`.\n2. Analyze the algorithm's memory usage: Measure the amount of memory the algorithm uses as the input size increases.\n3. Identify the dominant term: Identify the term that grows the fastest as the input size increases. This is usually the term that dominates the space complexity.\n4.

An algorithm can have a high time complexity but a low space complexity, or vice versa. For example:\n\n* A sorting algorithm may have a time complexity of O(n log n) but a space complexity of O(1), since it only uses a constant amount of memory to store the sorting algorithm's state.\n* A caching algorithm may have a time complexity of O(1) but a space complexity of O(n), since it stores a large amount of data in memory.\n\n**Optimizing Space Complexity**\n\nHere are some common techniques used to optimize space complexity:\n\n1. **Data compression**: Reduce the amount of memory used by compressing data.\n2. **Caching**: Store frequently accessed data in a cache to reduce the amount of memory used.\n3. **Memoization**: Store the results of expensive function calls to avoid recalculating them.\n4. **Data structures**: Choose data structures that use less memory, such as arrays instead of linked lists.\n5. **Algorithmic optimization**: Optimize the algorithm to use less memory, such as by reducing the number of iterations or using more efficient algorithms.\n\n**Example: Optimizing a Hash Table**\n\nSuppose we have a hash table that stores a large amount of data:\n```python\ndef hash_table(data):\n    table = {}\n    for item in data:\n        table[item] = value\n    return table\n```\nThe space complexity of this algorithm is O(n), since it uses a hash table that grows linearly with the size of the input. To optimize this algorithm, we can use a fixed-size array instead of a hash table:\n```python\ndef hash_table(data):\n    table = [None] * 1000\n    for item in data:\n        table[item % 1000] = value\n    return table\n```\nThe space complexity of this optimized algorithm is O(1), since it uses a fixed-size array that does not grow with the size of the input."],"references":[null,null]}

This is a classic example of a reflected XSS vulnerability.\n\n**How it works**\n\nWhen a user submits the form, the JavaScript code in the `action` attribute will be executed, which will display an alert box with the message \"XSS Alert!\". This is because the `javascript:` protocol is used, which tells the browser to execute the code as JavaScript.\n\n**Exploitation**\n\nAn attacker can exploit this vulnerability by tricking a user into visiting the vulnerable page and submitting the form. The attacker can do this by creating a malicious link that points to the vulnerable page, with the `name` parameter set to a JavaScript code that will be executed when the form is submitted.\n\nFor example, the attacker can create a link like this:\n```\n<a href=\"http:\/\/example.com\/index.html?name=<script>alert('XSS Alert!');<\/script>\">Click me!<\/a>\n```\nWhen the user clicks the link, the browser will submit the form and execute the malicious JavaScript code, which will display the alert box.\n\n**Consequences**\n\nXSS vulnerabilities can have serious consequences, including:\n\n* Stealing sensitive information, such as login credentials or credit card numbers\n* Hijacking user sessions and taking control of the user's account\n* Installing malware or viruses on the user's computer\n* Disrupting the normal functioning of the website or application\n\n**Prevention**\n\nTo prevent XSS vulnerabilities, it's essential to validate and sanitize user input, especially when it comes to JavaScript code. This can be done using techniques such as:\n\n* Encoding special characters\n* Using a Content Security Policy (CSP) to define which sources of content are allowed\n* Using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block malicious traffic\n\nI hope this example helps illustrate the concept of XSS and how it can be exploited. Remember to always prioritize security when building web applications!","**XSS Prevention Methods**\n\nXSS (Cross-Site Scripting) is a serious security threat that can compromise the security of your web application. Here are some methods to prevent XSS attacks:\n\n### 1. **Input Validation**\n\nValidate all user input data, including forms, cookies, and HTTP requests. Use a whitelist approach to only allow specific characters and formats.\n\n### 2. **Output Encoding**\n\nEncode all user input data before outputting it to the browser.

It is a simple and efficient way to introduce non-linearity into the network, allowing the model to learn more complex relationships between inputs and outputs.\n\nThe ReLU function is defined as:\n\n`f(x) = max(0, x)`\n\nIn other words, ReLU takes the input `x` and returns `x` if it's positive, and 0 if it's negative. This means that all negative values are \"clipped\" to 0, while positive values are passed through unchanged.\n\nReLU has several advantages:\n\n1. **Computational efficiency**: ReLU is very fast to compute, as it only requires a simple comparison and a maximum function.\n2. **Simplifies optimization**: ReLU makes the optimization process easier, as the derivative of ReLU is either 0 or 1, which simplifies the backpropagation process.\n3. **Prevents dying neurons**: ReLU helps prevent \"dying neurons\", where a neuron becomes stuck in a state where it always outputs 0, making it useless for the network.\n\n**Other activation functions**\n\nWhile ReLU is a popular choice, there are other activation functions that can be used in neural networks. Some common alternatives include:\n\n1. **Sigmoid**: `f(x) = 1 \/ (1 + exp(-x))`\n\t* Sigmoid is similar to ReLU, but it maps the input to a value between 0 and 1. This can be useful for binary classification problems.\n2. **Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent)**: `f(x) = tanh(x)`\n\t* Tanh is similar to Sigmoid, but it maps the input to a value between -1 and 1. This can be useful for problems where the output needs to be in a specific range.\n3. **Softmax**: `f(x) = exp(x) \/ sum(exp(x))`\n\t* Softmax is often used in the output layer of a neural network for multi-class classification problems. It maps the input to a probability distribution over all classes.\n4. **Leaky ReLU**: `f(x) = max(0.01x, x)`\n\t* Leaky ReLU is a variation of ReLU that allows a small fraction of the input to pass through even when it's negative. This can help prevent dying neurons.\n5. **Swish**: `f(x) = x * sigmoid(beta * x)`\n\t* Swish is a recently introduced activation function that is similar to ReLU, but with a learnable parameter `beta`. This allows the network to adapt the activation function during training.\n\nEach activation function has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of activation function depends on the specific problem and network architecture."],"references":[null,null]}

This is the most common HTTP method, used to request data from a server. For example, when you enter a URL in your browser, a GET request is sent to the server to retrieve the HTML content of the page.\n2. **POST**: Sends data to the server to create a new resource. This method is used to send data to the server, such as when submitting a form or sending a file. The server processes the data and returns a response.\n3. **PUT**: Updates an existing resource on the server. This method is used to update the contents of a resource, such as updating a user's profile information.\n4. **DELETE**: Deletes a resource from the server. This method is used to delete a resource, such as deleting a user account.\n5. **HEAD**: Retrieves metadata about a resource from the server. This method is similar to GET, but only returns the metadata (e.g., headers) of the resource, without the actual content.\n\n**HTTP\/2 Methods**\n\nHTTP\/2 introduces some new methods, but the above 5 methods are still widely used. Here are a few additional methods introduced in HTTP\/2:\n\n1. **CONNECT**: Establishes a tunnel to the server. This method is used to establish a secure connection to a server, such as when using HTTPS.\n2. **OPTIONS**: Returns the HTTP methods supported by the server. This method is used to query the server about the available HTTP methods.\n3. **PATCH**: Partially updates a resource on the server. This method is used to update a resource, but only for specific fields or attributes.\n\nNote that HTTP\/2 also introduces some new features, such as multiplexing, header compression, and binary framing, which improve the performance and efficiency of HTTP communication. However, the above 5 methods remain the most commonly used and widely supported HTTP methods.","PUT and PATCH are both used to update a resource on the server, but they differ in their approach and scope of changes:\n\n**PUT**:\n\n* Replaces the entire resource with the new data sent in the request body.\n* The entire resource is updated, including all its attributes and values.\n* The request body should contain the complete representation of the resource in its entirety.\n* If the resource does not exist, a new resource is created.\n* If the resource exists, its entire contents are replaced.\n\nExample: Updating a user's profile information, including all fields, using a PUT request.\n\n**PATCH**:\n\n* Modifies a subset of attributes of the resource, without replacing the entire resource.\n* Only the specified fields or attributes are updated, leaving the rest of the resource unchanged.\n* The request body typically contains a patch document that specifies the changes to be made.\n* If the resource does not exist, a 404 error is typically returned.\n* If the resource exists, only the specified fields are updated.\n\nExample: Updating a user's email address using a PATCH request, without changing other profile information.\n\nIn summary:\n\n* PUT is used to replace the entire resource, while PATCH is used to update a subset of attributes.\n* PUT is typically used for complete updates, while PATCH is used for partial updates.\n\nWhen deciding between PUT and PATCH, consider the following:\n\n* If you need to update the entire resource, use PUT.\n* If you need to update only a specific part of the resource, use PATCH.\n* If you're unsure, use PATCH, as it provides more flexibility and control over the update process."],"references":["GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, HEAD, TRACE, CONNECT 중 5개를 설명","PUT은 전체를 업데이트하는 반면, PATCH는 일부를 업데이트한다."]}

We convert the input list `characters` to a set using the `set()` function. This removes duplicates from the list.\n2. We iterate over the set using a for loop.\n3. For each character `char` in the set, we check if the count of `char` in the original list `characters` is equal to 1 using the `count()` method. If it is, it means that `char` is the first unique character in the list.\n4. We return the unique character.\n\nHere are some test cases:\n```\nprint(find_unique_character(['a', 'b', 'c', 'a', 'd']))  # Output: 'b'\nprint(find_unique_character(['a', 'b', 'a', 'b', 'c']))  # Output: 'c'\nprint(find_unique_character(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']))  # Output: 'a'\n```\nNote that this solution assumes that the input list is not empty and that there is at least one unique character in the list. If the input list is empty or has no unique characters, the function will raise an error. You may want to add error handling to handle these cases if necessary.","Here are some ways to increase the difficulty of the problem:\n\n1. **Case-insensitive comparison**: Instead of considering characters as case-sensitive, make the function ignore case. For example, 'A' and 'a' should be considered the same character.\n2. **Non-ASCII characters**: Allow the input list to contain non-ASCII characters, such as accented letters, punctuation, or special characters. This will require the function to handle Unicode characters correctly.\n3. **Empty strings**: Allow the input list to contain empty strings. The function should ignore empty strings and only consider non-empty strings.\n4. **Multiple unique characters**: Instead of returning the first unique character, return all unique characters in the list. This will require the function to keep track of all unique characters and return them in some order (e.g., alphabetical order).\n5. **Large input lists**: Increase the size of the input list to make the function more challenging to implement efficiently. For example, use a list of 100,000 characters or more.\n6. **Edge cases**: Add edge cases to the problem, such as:\n\t* An empty input list\n\t* A list with only one element\n\t* A list with all duplicate characters\n\t* A list with all unique characters\n7. **Performance optimization**: Add a requirement to optimize the function for performance. For example, the function should be able to handle large input lists in a reasonable amount of time.\n8. **Additional constraints**: Add additional constraints to the problem, such as:\n\t* The function should only consider characters that are in a specific range (e.g., only letters or only digits)\n\t* The function should ignore characters that are in a specific range (e.g., ignore punctuation or whitespace characters)\n\nBy adding these challenges, you can make the problem more difficult and require more advanced programming skills to solve."],"references":[null,null]}

He claims that deep work is not just a technical skill, but a superpower that can help individuals create new values, improve their work, and make it difficult for others to imitate.\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\nB) 작업의 자동화 증가 (Automation of work) is mentioned as a consequence of technological advancements, but it is not a characteristic of deep work.\n\nC) 만족감과 웰빙의 감각 (Sense of satisfaction and well-being) is mentioned as a benefit of deep work, but it is not the main focus of deep work.\n\nD) 일과 생활에서의 더 큰 만족감 (Greater satisfaction in work and life) is mentioned as a benefit of deep work, but it is not the main focus of deep work.\n\nNewport's perspective on deep work is that it requires individuals to resist distractions, stay focused, and immerse themselves in a single task, which can lead to greater satisfaction and well-being, but also to increased productivity and the creation of new values.","Today's education system can both support and hinder the development of deep work skills in students. Here are some ways in which the education system can support or hinder deep work skills:\n\n**Supporting deep work skills:**\n\n1. **Focus on critical thinking and problem-solving**: Many educational institutions emphasize critical thinking and problem-solving skills, which are essential for deep work. By encouraging students to think critically and solve complex problems, educators can help students develop the ability to focus and immerse themselves in a task.\n2. **Long-term projects and assignments**: Assignments that require students to work on a project over an extended period can help them develop the ability to focus and make progress on a single task.\n3. **Minimal distractions**: Some educational institutions are implementing policies to minimize distractions, such as turning off notifications or creating quiet spaces for students to work.\n4. **Emphasis on self-directed learning**: Encouraging students to take ownership of their learning and set their own goals can help them develop the ability to focus and work independently.\n\n**Hindering deep work skills:**\n\n1. **Multitasking and distractions**: The widespread use of digital devices and social media can make it difficult for students to focus and resist distractions.\n2. **Short-term assignments and quizzes**: Frequent short-term assignments and quizzes can create a culture of constant switching between tasks, making it difficult for students to develop the ability to focus on a single task.\n3. **Overemphasis on grades and competition**: The emphasis on grades and competition can create a culture of stress and anxiety, making it difficult for students to relax and focus on their work.\n4. **Lack of autonomy**: Micromanaging and lack of autonomy can make students feel like they are not in control of their learning, leading to a lack of motivation and focus.\n5. **Too much emphasis on busywork**: Assigning busywork or tasks that are not meaningful or relevant to the student's goals can lead to a lack of engagement and motivation, making it difficult for students to develop deep work skills.\n\nTo support deep work skills, educators can:\n\n1. Encourage students to set goals and work independently\n2. Provide opportunities for long-term projects and assignments\n3. Minimize distractions and create quiet spaces for students to work\n4. Emphasize critical thinking and problem-solving skills\n5. Encourage self-directed learning and autonomy\n6. Provide feedback and guidance rather than constant monitoring and evaluation\n7. Encourage students to take breaks and practice self-care to avoid burnout\n\nBy implementing these strategies, educators can help students develop the skills and habits necessary for deep work, which can lead to greater productivity, creativity, and overall well-being."],"references":["B",null]}

The dish is not only visually appealing, but also packed with nutrients and flavor.\n\nThe key to a great Bibimbap is the quality of the ingredients. The rice is cooked to a perfect fluffy texture, and the vegetables are carefully selected to provide a mix of crunch, sweetness, and texture. The meats, usually beef or chicken, are marinated in a sweet and savory sauce that adds depth to the dish. And of course, the fried egg adds a creamy and rich element to the dish.\n\nTo make Bibimbap, start by cooking the rice according to the package instructions. While the rice is cooking, prepare the vegetables by sautéing them in a little oil until they're tender but still crisp. You can use a variety of vegetables such as bean sprouts, zucchini, carrots, and mushrooms. Next, cook the meat of your choice (I prefer beef) in a separate pan with some oil and soy sauce until it's cooked through. Finally, fry an egg in a little oil and set it aside.\n\nTo assemble the dish, place a scoop of cooked rice in a bowl, followed by a layer of vegetables, a slice of meat, and a fried egg on top. Drizzle the dish with a spicy chili pepper paste called gochujang, which adds a bold and savory flavor. You can also add some kimchi, a spicy fermented Korean cabbage, on the side for extra flavor.\n\nOverall, Bibimbap is a delicious and satisfying dish that's perfect for a quick and easy lunch or dinner. With its combination of flavors, textures, and nutrients, it's no wonder it's a popular dish in Korea and around the world.

For example: \"사과를 먹어요\" (sa-gwa-reul meo-yeo-yo) means \"I eat an apple.\"\n2. **Apology** (): In this sense, \"사과\" means to apologize or to express regret for something. For example: \"사과합니다\" (sa-gwa-ham-ni-da) means \"I apologize\" or \"I'm sorry.\"\n\nThese two meanings are quite different, but both are important and commonly used in everyday Korean language! 😊","😊\n\nIn linguistics, \"동음이의어\" (dong-eum-i-eui-eo) and \"다의어\" (da-ui-eo) are two related but distinct concepts.\n\n**동음이의어 (Homophone)**:\n\n* A homophone is a word that is pronounced the same as another word, but has a different meaning.\n* Homophones are words that are pronounced identically, but have different spellings and meanings.\n* Examples in Korean: (cha) meaning \"tea\" and (cha) meaning \"car\" are homophones.\n\n**다의어 (Polyseme)**:\n\n* A polyseme is a word that has multiple related meanings, but not necessarily identical pronunciations.\n* Polysemes are words that have multiple senses or connotations, often with a common core meaning or association.\n* Examples in Korean: the word \"사과\" (sa-gwa) we discussed earlier, which means both \"apple\" and \"apology\", is a polyseme.\n\nIn summary:\n\n* Homophones are words that are pronounced the same but have different meanings.\n* Polysemes are words that have multiple related meanings, but not necessarily identical pronunciations.\n\nWhile homophones are about identical pronunciation, polysemes are about related meanings.

In this sentence, the first clause \"이 세상에는 아름다운 것들이 참으로 많다고들 한다\" suggests that many beautiful things exist in the world, while the second clause \"나는 그런 아름다움을 모른다\" indicates that the speaker does not know about those beautiful things. The contrast between the two clauses is highlighted by the use of \"그러나\", which implies that the speaker's lack of knowledge about beautiful things is in contrast to the existence of those things.\n\nThe other options do not fit as well:\n\n* \"그래서\" is a causal conjunction that indicates a cause-and-effect relationship, which is not suitable in this context.\n* \"그리고\" is a coordinating conjunction that connects two clauses without indicating a specific relationship between them, which is not suitable in this context.\n* \"따라서\" is a causal conjunction that indicates a cause-and-effect relationship, but it implies a logical consequence, which is not suitable in this context.","There are several conjunctions in Korean that have a similar function to \"그러나\" in indicating contrast or contrastive relationship between two clauses. Some examples include:\n\n* \"하지만\" (but): This conjunction is often used to indicate a contrast between two clauses, similar to \"그러나\". For example: \"이 세상에는 아름다운 것들이 많지만 나는 그런 아름다움을 모른다\" (There are many beautiful things in the world, but I don't know about them).\n* \"에도\" (even though): This conjunction is used to indicate a contrast between two clauses, often with a sense of concession. For example: \"이 세상에는 아름다운 것들이 많에도 나는 그런 아름다움을 모른다\" (There are many beautiful things in the world, even though I don't know about them).\n* \"에도나\" (even if): This conjunction is used to indicate a contrast between two clauses, often with a sense of concession. For example: \"이 세상에는 아름다운 것들이 많에도나 나는 그런 아름다움을 모른다\" (There are many beautiful things in the world, even if I don't know about them).\n* \"아니면\" (or): This conjunction is used to indicate a contrast between two clauses, often with a sense of alternative. For example: \"이 세상에는 아름다운 것들이 많아니면 나는 그런 아름다움을 모른다\" (There are many beautiful things in the world, or I don't know about them).\n\nThese conjunctions can be used in different contexts and with different nuances, but they all serve to indicate a contrast or contrastive relationship between two clauses."],"references":["2. 그러나",null]}

Therefore, the correct pronunciation of \"쫓는\" is [tɕaɲɯn], where the ㄷ is pronounced as a null consonant (ㅇ) and the vowel ㅏ is pronounced as a mid-central vowel [a].\n\nSo, the answer is that the pronunciation of \"쫓는\" is [tɕaɲɯn].","You're asking about the phenomenon where the consonant ㅋ is pronounced as ʎ (a palatal approximant) due to the influence of the preceding vowel.
