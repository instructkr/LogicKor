However, the ambiguity of justice can lead to controversies and disagreements in its interpretation. So, how can we establish a universal definition of justice that is acceptable to the majority of society?\n\nHere are some possible approaches to consider:\n\n1. **Philosophical inquiry**: Engage in a thorough examination of philosophical theories of justice, such as John Rawls' \"A Theory of Justice\" or Amartya Sen's \"The Idea of Justice.\" These theories can provide a framework for understanding the concept of justice and its various aspects.\n2. **Cross-cultural analysis**: Study the concept of justice across different cultures and societies, identifying commonalities and differences. This can help reveal universal principles and values that are widely accepted.\n3. **Empirical research**: Conduct surveys, interviews, and focus groups to gather data on how people from diverse backgrounds perceive and understand justice. This can provide insights into the common values and principles that underlie people's notions of justice.\n4. **Deliberative democracy**: Organize deliberative forums, where citizens from diverse backgrounds engage in informed, respectful, and open-minded discussions about justice. This can help build a shared understanding of justice and identify areas of agreement.\n5. **International human rights law**: Draw on international human rights law, which provides a framework for understanding justice in terms of universal human rights and dignity. This can serve as a foundation for developing a shared understanding of justice.\n6. **Contextualization**: Recognize that justice is context-dependent and can vary depending on the specific social, cultural, and historical context. This approach acknowledges that justice is not a fixed concept, but rather a dynamic and evolving notion that requires ongoing dialogue and adaptation.\n7. **Inclusive and participatory processes**: Involve diverse stakeholders, including marginalized groups, in the process of defining and shaping justice. This can help ensure that the concept of justice is inclusive, equitable, and responsive to the needs of all members of society.\n8. **Education and critical thinking**: Foster critical thinking and education about justice, encouraging people to engage with different perspectives and theories. This can help develop a more nuanced and informed understanding of justice.\n9. **Interdisciplinary approaches**: Draw on insights from various disciplines, such as philosophy, sociology, psychology, economics, and law, to develop a more comprehensive understanding of justice.\n10. **Ongoing dialogue and reflection**: Recognize that the concept of justice is not fixed and requires ongoing dialogue, reflection, and adaptation. This approach acknowledges that justice is a dynamic and evolving notion that requires continuous engagement and refinement.\n\nBy combining these approaches, we can work towards establishing a universal definition of justice that is acceptable to the majority of society. However, it is essential to acknowledge that the concept of justice will always be subject to interpretation and debate, and that ongoing dialogue and reflection are necessary to ensure that our understanding of justice remains relevant and effective. 💡","Here is a summary of the previous response in three English sentences:\n\nTo establish a universal definition of justice, we can combine philosophical inquiry, cross-cultural analysis, and empirical research to identify common values and principles. Inclusive and participatory processes can help ensure that the concept of justice is responsive to the needs of all members of society. Ongoing dialogue and reflection are necessary to refine our understanding of justice and adapt it to changing social and cultural contexts.\n\nAnd here are three words from the summary sentences with their meanings:\n\n1. **Inclusive**: (adjective) meaning to include or involve people from all backgrounds, cultures, and identities, without excluding anyone. In the context of justice, inclusive means that the concept is designed to be fair and equitable for all individuals, regardless of their race, gender, religion, or other characteristics.\n2. **Participatory**: (adjective) meaning to involve people in the process of decision-making or shaping a concept, in this case, justice. Participatory approaches ensure that diverse voices and perspectives are heard and valued, leading to a more representative and effective understanding of justice.\n3. **Refine**: (verb) meaning to improve or make something more precise or accurate. In the context of justice, refine means to continually evaluate and adjust our understanding of justice to ensure it remains relevant, effective, and responsive to the needs of society."],"references":[null,null]}

Here are some reasons:\n\n1. **Noodle texture**: Ramen noodles are designed to cook in a specific amount of water to achieve the right texture. If you use too much water, the noodles may become mushy or overcooked, losing their signature chewiness.\n2. **Seasoning distribution**: The seasoning packet is formulated to dissolve and distribute evenly in a certain amount of water. If you use too much water, the seasonings may not dissolve properly, resulting in an unbalanced flavor.\n3. **Flavor concentration**: Ramen broth is designed to be concentrated and rich. If you dilute it with too much water, the flavor may become weak and unappetizing.\n4. **Starch and gelatinization**: Ramen noodles contain starches that gelatinize when cooked in water. If you use too much water, the starches may not gelatinize properly, affecting the noodle's texture and mouthfeel.\n\nThe recommended water amount for cooking ramen is usually around 400-500ml per packet, which allows for the right balance of noodle texture, seasoning distribution, flavor concentration, and starch gelatinization.\n\nSo, while it may seem counterintuitive to use less water than the total volume of two packets, it's actually the key to achieving the perfect bowl of ramen 😋","🤔\n\nThe amount of water evaporation during ramen cooking is influenced by several factors. Here are some of the key ones:\n\n1. **Heat intensity**: The higher the heat, the faster the water evaporates. If you're using a high-heat stove or a powerful electric kettle, more water will evaporate during cooking.\n2. **Cooking time**: The longer you cook the ramen, the more water will evaporate. This is why it's essential to cook ramen for the recommended time to avoid overcooking and excessive water loss.\n3. **Pot material and size**: The material and size of the pot can affect evaporation rates. For example, a smaller pot with a thicker bottom may retain heat better and reduce evaporation, while a larger pot with a thinner bottom may lead to more evaporation.\n4. **Lid usage**: Covering the pot with a lid can reduce evaporation by trapping the steam inside. However, if the lid is not tight-fitting, steam can still escape, leading to evaporation.\n5. **Altitude and atmospheric pressure**: At higher elevations, the air pressure is lower, which can lead to faster evaporation. This is why cooking times and water ratios may need to be adjusted when cooking at high altitudes.\n6. **Humidity**: Cooking in a humid environment can reduce evaporation, as the air is already saturated with moisture. In contrast, cooking in a dry environment can lead to faster evaporation.\n7. **Stirring and agitation**: Frequent stirring or agitation can increase evaporation by introducing more air into the pot and disrupting the water's surface tension.\n8. **Initial water temperature**: If the water is already hot when you add the noodles, less evaporation will occur during cooking. This is why some ramen enthusiasts recommend using hot water to start with.\n9. **Noodle type and quantity**: Different types and quantities of noodles can affect evaporation rates. For example, thicker noodles may absorb more water and reduce evaporation, while thinner noodles may lead to more evaporation.\n\nBy understanding these factors, you can adjust your cooking technique and environment to minimize water evaporation and achieve the perfect bowl of ramen 😊"],"references":["물의 증발량은 라면 1개를 끓일 때와 2개를 끓일 때 거의 같다. 따라서, 라면을 2개를 끓일 때는 1100mL보다 적은 양의 물을 사용해도 된다.",null]}

Here's a logical development of this argument:\n\n**Argument:**\n\n1. **Free market principles**: In a capitalist system, individuals are free to make choices about how they spend their time and money. If people choose to use SNS to showcase their lives and consume products to maintain a certain image, it is their prerogative.\n2. **Supply and demand**: The demand for SNS platforms and the products and services advertised on them is driven by consumer desire. As long as there is a demand, businesses will supply these products and services, creating jobs and driving economic growth.\n3. **Innovation and competition**: The competition among SNS platforms and businesses to attract and retain users drives innovation, leading to improved products and services that meet consumer needs.\n4. **Personal responsibility**: Individuals are responsible for their own actions and choices. If someone chooses to overspend or engage in excessive consumption to maintain a certain image on SNS, it is their personal responsibility, not a problem for society as a whole.\n5. **Economic growth**: The increased consumption driven by SNS use contributes to economic growth, as businesses benefit from the increased demand for their products and services.\n6. **Job creation**: The growth of the SNS industry and related businesses creates jobs, from software development to marketing and advertising, which contributes to economic stability and growth.\n7. **Tax revenue**: Governments benefit from the tax revenue generated by the SNS industry and related businesses, which can be used to fund public services and infrastructure.\n\n**Counterarguments and responses:**\n\n**Counterargument 1:** Excessive consumption and materialism can lead to negative social and environmental consequences, such as waste, pollution, and inequality.\n\n**Response:** While these consequences are valid concerns, they can be addressed through regulation and education. Governments can implement policies to mitigate the negative effects of consumption, and individuals can be educated on the importance of sustainable consumption practices.\n\n**Counterargument 2:** The pressure to maintain a certain image on SNS can lead to mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression.\n\n**Response:** While mental health is a serious concern, it is not necessarily a problem caused by SNS use. Individuals can take responsibility for their own mental health by practicing self-care and setting boundaries on their SNS use.\n\n**Counterargument 3:** The commercialization of SNS platforms can lead to the exploitation of users' personal data and the manipulation of their behavior.\n\n**Response:** While data privacy and manipulation are valid concerns, they can be addressed through regulation and industry self-regulation. Users can also take steps to protect their personal data and be aware of the potential risks associated with SNS use.\n\nIn conclusion, from a capitalist perspective, the phenomenon of using SNS as a means of self-realization and the subsequent increase in consumption is not a problem.

The optimal strategy to maximize the probability of all prisoners finding their corresponding locker is as follows:\n\n1. Each prisoner opens 50 lockers, but not randomly. Instead, they open the locker corresponding to their own number, and then the locker corresponding to the number they find in the first locker, and then the locker corresponding to the number they find in the second locker, and so on.\n2. If a prisoner finds their own number, they stop opening lockers and remember the number of the locker where they found it.\n3. If a prisoner reaches the 50th locker without finding their own number, they stop and remember the number of the last locker they opened.\n\nThis strategy is known as the \"sequential searching\" strategy. It may seem counterintuitive, but it has been proven to be the optimal strategy to maximize the probability of all prisoners finding their corresponding locker.\n\nThe probability of success using this strategy is approximately 30.68%. This may seem low, but it's actually much higher than the probability of success if each prisoner were to open 50 lockers randomly, which would be around 1%.\n\nThe key insight behind this strategy is that by opening the lockers in a sequential manner, each prisoner is able to gather information about the location of their own number, and use that information to inform their subsequent searches. This allows them to make more informed decisions about which lockers to open, and increases the chances of finding their own number.","The strategy I described earlier, known as the \"sequential searching\" strategy, is still optimal even when the number of prisoners (or employees) is 30 and each can open 15 boxes.\n\nIn fact, the strategy remains optimal as long as the number of boxes each prisoner can open is at least half the total number of prisoners. In this case, since 15 is greater than half of 30, the sequential searching strategy is still the best approach.\n\nThe probability of success will be lower than in the original case with 100 prisoners and 50 boxes, but it will still be higher than if each prisoner were to open 15 boxes randomly.\n\nTo give you a rough idea, the probability of success with 30 prisoners and 15 boxes per prisoner is around 18.3%. Again, this may seem low, but it's still much higher than the probability of success if each prisoner were to open 15 boxes randomly, which would be around 1%.\n\nSo, to answer your question, yes, the sequential searching strategy is still valid and optimal even with 30 prisoners and 15 boxes per prisoner."],"references":["이 문제는 원순열(순환이 이루어지는 순열)을 이용해서 풀 수 있다. 해당 전략을 이용하면 (1\/2)^100의 확률을 약 0.31까지 올릴 수 있다.","유효하다."]}

This means that the slope of the line is equal to the slope of the tangent line to the circle at these points.\n\nUsing the equation of the line, we can find the slope of the line:\n\nm = (3\/4)\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the slope of the tangent line to the circle at a point (x, y) is given by:\n\nm_t = -(x - h) \/ (y - k)\n\nwhere (h, k) is the center of the circle.\n\nSince the slope of the line is equal to the slope of the tangent line, we can set up the equation:\n\n(3\/4) = -(x - h) \/ (y - k)\n\nSubstituting the points (0, 2) and (4, 5) into this equation, we get:\n\n(3\/4) = -(-h) \/ (2 - k)\n(3\/4) = -(4 - h) \/ (5 - k)\n\nSimplifying these equations, we get:\n\nh = 2k - 3\nh = (4k - 15) \/ 3\n\nEquating these two expressions for h, we get:\n\n2k - 3 = (4k - 15) \/ 3\n\nSolving for k, we get:\n\nk = 9\/2\n\nSubstituting this value of k into one of the equations for h, we get:\n\nh = 2(9\/2) - 3\nh = 15\/2 - 3\nh = 9\/2\n\nNow that we have the values of h and k, we can substitute them into one of the equations (1) or (2) to find the value of r.\n\nSubstituting h = 9\/2 and k = 9\/2 into equation (1), we get:\n\n(0 - 9\/2)^2 + (2 - 9\/2)^2 = r^2\n(9\/2)^2 + (-1\/2)^2 = r^2\nr^2 = 85\/4\n\nr = √(85\/4)\n\nSo, the equation of the circle passing through the points (0, 2) and (4, 5) is:\n\n(x - 9\/2)^2 + (y - 9\/2)^2 = 85\/4\n\nThe necessary condition for a circle to pass through two points is that the center of the circle lies on the perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining the two points. In this case, the center of the circle is (9\/2, 9\/2), which lies on the perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining the points (0, 2) and (4, 5).","Let's rewrite the equation of the line in terms of x.\n\nWe have:\n\ny = (3\/4)x + 2\n\nTo solve for x, we can subtract 2 from both sides:\n\ny - 2 = (3\/4)x\n\nThen, we can multiply both sides by 4\/3:\n\n(4\/3)(y - 2) = x\n\nx = (4\/3)y - 8\/3\n\nThis is the equation of the line in terms of x."],"references":["직선의 방정식은 y = 3\/4x + 2이며, 원의 방정식을 하나로 정의하기 위해서는 원이 지나는 점 하나를 더 정의하거나, 원의 반지름을 두 점 사이의 거리의 반으로 정의해야 한다. 단, 이때 원이 지나는 점 세 개는 한 직선 위에 있어서는 안 된다.

She had expected the past to be different, but nothing could have prepared her for the sheer chaos of it all.\n\nAs she struggled to get her bearings, a group of rowdy teenagers bumped into her, sending her stumbling backward. Apologetic faces blurred together as she regained her balance. That was when she saw him – a boy with piercing blue eyes and a messy mop of hair, who looked like he'd just rolled out of bed.\n\n\"Hey, are you okay?\" he asked, concern etched on his face.\n\nAria's mind raced. Who was this boy? And why did she feel an inexplicable connection to him?\n\n\"I... I think so,\" she stammered, trying to process her surroundings.\n\nThe boy smiled and introduced himself as Taro. As they exchanged awkward small talk, Aria's gaze drifted to the school building behind him. A sign read \"Tokyo Metropolitan High School\" in bold kanji characters.\n\nSuddenly, it clicked. This was where she was meant to be. This was where her mission began.\n\nBut as she turned to leave, Aria caught a glimpse of herself in a reflection – and her heart skipped a beat.

What have I learned about myself and the universe?\n\n**Sample Journal Entry:**\n\n**Entry 12, Galactic Cycle 3456**\n\nI'm sitting in the observation deck of our spaceship, gazing out at the endless expanse of stars. It's been 200 days since we left Earth's orbit, and the ache of homesickness still lingers. I miss the warmth of the sun on my skin, the taste of fresh fruit, and the sound of laughter echoing through the streets.\n\nToday, I caught myself reminiscing about the smell of rain on dry soil. It's a scent that's both earthy and refreshing, like a breath of fresh air. I remember walking through the streets of Tokyo after a summer storm, feeling the cool mist on my face and the smell of wet pavement. It's a sensation that's impossible to replicate in the sterile environment of our ship.\n\nAs I look out at the stars, I'm struck by the vastness of the universe. The planets we've visited so far are barren and unforgiving, their landscapes a harsh reminder of the beauty and fragility of Earth. I've seen towering mountains of ice on Neptune's moon, Triton, and the scorched, crimson landscape of Mars. But none of these sights can compare to the vibrant diversity of my home planet.\n\nBeing in space has changed me in ways I never thought possible. I've learned to appreciate the beauty of simplicity, the importance of community, and the resilience of the human spirit.

Here are some of the key differences:\n\n1. **Unfamiliar surroundings**: As a space traveler, I'm constantly surrounded by unfamiliar environments, from the interior of a spaceship to the alien landscapes of other planets. This lack of familiarity can make it harder to find inspiration and reference points for my writing.\n2. **Disconnection from nature**: On Earth, I could draw inspiration from the natural world, observing the changing seasons, the behavior of animals, or the beauty of landscapes. In space, I'm disconnected from the natural world, and my surroundings are often sterile and artificial.\n3. **Time dilation and relativity**: As I travel at high speeds or experience intense gravitational forces, my perception of time becomes distorted. This can make it challenging to keep a consistent writing schedule or even to track the passage of time.\n4. **Isolation and confinement**: Space travel often involves prolonged periods of isolation and confinement, which can take a toll on my mental and emotional well-being. This can make it harder to find the motivation and energy to write.\n5. **Limited resources**: In space, resources are limited, and I may not have access to the same writing tools or materials that I would on Earth. This could include limitations on paper, ink, or even digital storage.\n6. **Unreliable communication**: Depending on my location and the quality of communication equipment, I may not be able to share my journal entries with others or receive feedback and support. This can make me feel disconnected and isolated.\n7. **Shift in perspective**: As I travel through space, my perspective on the universe and humanity's place in it is constantly shifting. This can make it challenging to maintain a consistent tone or theme in my writing.\n8. **Coping with the unknown**: Space travel involves encountering the unknown, whether it's strange celestial bodies, unfamiliar alien species, or unexplained phenomena. This can create a sense of unease or uncertainty that can be difficult to express in writing.\n9. **Maintaining a sense of identity**: As I adapt to new environments and experiences, I may struggle to maintain a sense of identity and connection to my past self. This can make it harder to write about my thoughts and feelings in a way that feels authentic.\n10. **The burden of representation**: As one of the few humans in space, I may feel a sense of responsibility to represent humanity or to document my experiences for the benefit of others. This can add pressure and make writing feel more like a duty than a personal expression.\n\nThese challenges can make writing a journal as a space traveler more difficult than writing as an Earth dweller. However, they also provide a unique opportunity to explore new themes, ideas, and perspectives that can enrich my writing and provide a fresh perspective on the human experience."],"references":[null,null]}

Here's an attempt to imagine how he might view these issues from his perspective:\n\n**The fetishism of commodities**\n\nMarx would likely argue that Bitcoin, as a digital commodity, represents the ultimate form of fetishism. In his view, fetishism occurs when social relations between people are transformed into relations between things, and people begin to worship these things as if they had inherent value. Bitcoin, with its decentralized, digital nature, would be seen as the epitome of this process.\n\nMarx would contend that the value of Bitcoin is not derived from its usefulness or its ability to facilitate exchange, but rather from the social relations and power dynamics that underlie its creation and circulation. He would argue that the value of Bitcoin is a reflection of the social and economic power of those who control the means of production, distribution, and exchange.\n\n**The alienation of labor**\n\nMarx would likely see the rise of Bitcoin as a symptom of the alienation of labor in modern society. As people become increasingly disconnected from the means of production and the value of their labor, they seek alternative ways to accumulate wealth and status. Bitcoin, with its promise of easy wealth and decentralized control, would be seen as a way for individuals to regain a sense of control and agency in a system that has alienated them from their labor.\n\nHowever, Marx would argue that this is an illusion. The value of Bitcoin is ultimately derived from the labor and resources expended in its creation and maintenance, but this labor is not recognized or compensated fairly. Instead, the value of Bitcoin is captured by a small elite of investors and speculators, who reap the benefits of the labor of others.\n\n**The concentration of wealth and power**\n\nMarx would likely view the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few individuals and institutions in the Bitcoin ecosystem as a classic example of the contradictions of capitalism. He would argue that the decentralized nature of Bitcoin is an illusion, and that the system is ultimately controlled by a small group of powerful actors who manipulate the market to their advantage.\n\nMarx would contend that the concentration of wealth and power in the Bitcoin ecosystem is a reflection of the broader trends of neoliberal capitalism, which prioritizes the interests of the wealthy and powerful over those of the majority. He would argue that the rise of Bitcoin is a symptom of a system that is fundamentally unjust and unsustainable.\n\n**The crisis of capitalism**\n\nMarx would likely see the rise of Bitcoin as a symptom of a deeper crisis of capitalism. He would argue that the system is facing a crisis of overproduction, where the means of production have outstripped the ability of the market to absorb the goods and services produced. This crisis is manifesting in the form of speculative bubbles, such as the one surrounding Bitcoin.\n\nMarx would contend that the crisis of capitalism is a result of the contradictions between the productive forces of society and the relations of production. He would argue that the rise of Bitcoin is a desperate attempt to find new ways to accumulate wealth and power in a system that is fundamentally unsustainable.\n\n**The need for a new society**\n\nMarx would likely conclude that the rise of Bitcoin and the broader economic trends of our time are a call to action for a new society. He would argue that the contradictions of capitalism can only be resolved through the creation of a new society, based on the principles of cooperation, solidarity, and the collective ownership of the means of production.\n\nIn this new society, the value of labor would be recognized and compensated fairly, and the means of production would be controlled by the people, rather than a small elite of capitalists. Marx would contend that the rise of Bitcoin is a symptom of a system that is fundamentally broken, and that it is time to build a new society that is based on the principles of justice, equality, and democracy.","Analyzing modern society's problems from Karl Marx's perspective can be challenging due to several reasons:\n\n1. **Temporal disconnection**: Marx lived in the 19th century, and his theories were primarily based on the industrial capitalism of his time. Modern society has undergone significant changes, such as the rise of service-oriented economies, globalization, and the digital revolution, which may not be directly addressed in Marx's works.\n2. **Complexity of modern capitalism**: Modern capitalism is more complex and nuanced than the industrial capitalism Marx critiqued. The rise of finance capitalism, neoliberalism, and the gig economy, among other factors, have created new dynamics that may not fit neatly into Marx's framework.\n3. **Globalization and international relations**: Marx's focus was primarily on the national economy and the class struggle within it. However, modern society is characterized by globalization, international trade, and complex global power dynamics, which may require adaptations to Marx's theories.\n4. **Technological advancements**: The rapid development of technology has transformed the nature of work, production, and consumption. Marx's concepts, such as the labor theory of value, may need to be reevaluated in the context of automation, artificial intelligence, and the digital economy.\n5. **Changes in class structure**: Marx's theory of class struggle was based on the binary opposition between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. However, modern society has seen the emergence of new classes, such as the precariat, and changes in the nature of work and employment, which may require a redefinition of class categories.\n6. **Cultural and social changes**: Modern society has undergone significant cultural and social changes, such as the rise of identity politics, changes in family structures, and shifting values and norms. These changes may not be directly addressed in Marx's works and may require adaptations to his theories.\n7. **Methodological limitations**: Marx's methodology was based on a dialectical materialist approach, which may not be directly applicable to modern society's complex and rapidly changing dynamics. New methodologies and approaches may be needed to analyze modern society's problems from a Marxist perspective.\n8. **Interpretation and application**: Marx's theories are open to interpretation, and different scholars and activists may apply them in different ways. This can lead to debates and disagreements about how to analyze modern society's problems from a Marxist perspective.\n9. **Critiques and revisions**: Marx's theories have been subject to various critiques and revisions over the years. Some scholars have argued that Marx's ideas need to be revised or updated to address modern society's problems, while others argue that his theories remain relevant and applicable.\n10. **Contextualizing Marx**: Marx's theories were developed in a specific historical and cultural context. To apply his ideas to modern society, it is necessary to contextualize them and consider how they can be adapted to contemporary issues and challenges.\n\nBy acknowledging these challenges, scholars and activists can engage in a more nuanced and informed discussion about how to analyze modern society's problems from a Marxist perspective."],"references":[null,null]}

It's a way to analyze the performance of an algorithm, and it's usually expressed using Big O notation.\n\n**How to Calculate Time Complexity**\n\nTo calculate the time complexity of an algorithm, you need to identify the operations that are performed and count how many times each operation is executed. Here are some steps to follow:\n\n1. **Identify the operations**: Break down the algorithm into individual operations, such as assignments, comparisons, loops, and recursive calls.\n2. **Count the number of operations**: Count how many times each operation is executed. This can be done by analyzing the loop iterations, conditional statements, and recursive calls.\n3. **Express the time complexity**: Express the time complexity using Big O notation, which is a upper bound on the number of operations performed.\n\n**Big O Notation**\n\nBig O notation is a way to express the time complexity of an algorithm. It's an upper bound on the number of operations performed, and it's usually expressed as a function of the input size (typically denoted as 'n'). Here are some common examples of Big O notation:\n\n* O(1) - constant time complexity (the algorithm takes the same amount of time regardless of the input size)\n* O(log n) - logarithmic time complexity (the algorithm takes time proportional to the logarithm of the input size)\n* O(n) - linear time complexity (the algorithm takes time proportional to the input size)\n* O(n log n) - linearithmic time complexity (the algorithm takes time proportional to the product of the input size and its logarithm)\n* O(n^2) - quadratic time complexity (the algorithm takes time proportional to the square of the input size)\n* O(2^n) - exponential time complexity (the algorithm takes time proportional to 2 raised to the power of the input size)\n\n**Examples of Optimization Techniques**\n\nHere are some examples of optimization techniques that reduce time complexity:\n\n**Example 1: Binary Search**\n\nOriginal algorithm: Linear search (O(n))\nOptimized algorithm: Binary search (O(log n))\n\nIn linear search, we iterate through the entire array to find an element. In binary search, we divide the search space in half at each step, reducing the number of comparisons needed to find the element.\n\n**Example 2: Memoization**\n\nOriginal algorithm: Recursive Fibonacci sequence (O(2^n))\nOptimized algorithm: Memoized Fibonacci sequence (O(n))\n\nIn the recursive Fibonacci sequence, we compute the same subproblems multiple times, leading to an exponential time complexity. By memoizing the results of subproblems, we can avoid recomputing them and reduce the time complexity to linear.\n\n**Example 3: Dynamic Programming**\n\nOriginal algorithm: Recursive longest common subsequence (O(2^n))\nOptimized algorithm: Dynamic programming longest common subsequence (O(n^2))\n\nIn the recursive longest common subsequence algorithm, we compute the same subproblems multiple times, leading to an exponential time complexity. By using dynamic programming to store the results of subproblems, we can reduce the time complexity to quadratic.\n\nThese are just a few examples of optimization techniques that can reduce time complexity. There are many other techniques, such as caching, loop unrolling, and parallel processing, that can also be used to improve the performance of algorithms.","😊\n\n**Time Complexity vs Space Complexity**\n\nIn computer science, we analyze the performance of algorithms using two main metrics: time complexity and space complexity.\n\n**Time Complexity** (which we discussed earlier) measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete, usually expressed as a function of the input size. It's a measure of how long an algorithm takes to execute.\n\n**Space Complexity**, on the other hand, measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses, also expressed as a function of the input size. It's a measure of how much memory an algorithm requires to execute.\n\nIn other words, time complexity focuses on the **duration** of the algorithm, while space complexity focuses on the **memory usage** of the algorithm.\n\n**Why Space Complexity Matters**\n\nSpace complexity is important because it can affect the performance of an algorithm in several ways:\n\n1. **Memory constraints**: If an algorithm requires too much memory, it may not fit in the available memory, leading to slow performance or even crashes.\n2. **Cache performance**: If an algorithm uses too much memory, it may not fit in the cache, leading to slower performance due to cache misses.\n3. **Scalability**: Algorithms with high space complexity may not scale well for large inputs, making them impractical for real-world applications.\n\n**Examples of Space Complexity**\n\nHere are some examples of space complexity:\n\n* O(1) - constant space complexity (the algorithm uses a fixed amount of memory, regardless of the input size)\n* O(log n) - logarithmic space complexity (the algorithm uses memory proportional to the logarithm of the input size)\n* O(n) - linear space complexity (the algorithm uses memory proportional to the input size)\n* O(n^2) - quadratic space complexity (the algorithm uses memory proportional to the square of the input size)\n\n**Trade-offs between Time and Space Complexity**\n\nIn many cases, there's a trade-off between time and space complexity. For example:\n\n* An algorithm with high time complexity may have low space complexity (e.g., a recursive algorithm that uses little memory but takes a long time to execute)\n* An algorithm with low time complexity may have high space complexity (e.g., a dynamic programming algorithm that uses a lot of memory but executes quickly)\n\nOptimizing algorithms often involves finding a balance between time and space complexity, depending on the specific requirements of the problem and the available resources.\n\nI hope this helps clarify the difference between time and space complexity 😊"],"references":[null,null]}

{"id":27,"category":"코딩(Coding)","questions":["HTTP\/1.1 및 2의 주요 메서드 5개와 그들의 역할에 대하여 설명해보시오.","HTTP 메서드 중 PUT과 PATCH의 차이는 무엇인가?"],"outputs":["Here are the 5 main methods of HTTP\/1.1 and HTTP\/2, along with their roles:\n\n**HTTP\/1.1**\n\n1. **GET**: Retrieves a resource from the server. The client sends a request to the server, and the server responds with the requested resource. GET requests should not have any side effects on the server.\n\nRole: Retrieve a resource from the server.\n\nExample: `GET \/users` retrieves a list of users from the server.\n\n2. **POST**: Creates a new resource on the server. The client sends a request to the server with data, and the server creates a new resource based on that data.\n\nRole: Create a new resource on the server.\n\nExample: `POST \/users` creates a new user on the server with the provided data.\n\n3. **PUT**: Updates an existing resource on the server. The client sends a request to the server with updated data, and the server updates the existing resource.\n\nRole: Update an existing resource on the server.\n\nExample: `PUT \/users\/1` updates the user with ID 1 on the server with the provided data.\n\n4. **DELETE**: Deletes a resource from the server. The client sends a request to the server, and the server deletes the requested resource.\n\nRole: Delete a resource from the server.\n\nExample: `DELETE \/users\/1` deletes the user with ID 1 from the server.\n\n5. **HEAD**: Retrieves metadata about a resource from the server. The client sends a request to the server, and the server responds with metadata about the resource, such as its size and modification date.\n\nRole: Retrieve metadata about a resource from the server.\n\nExample: `HEAD \/users` retrieves metadata about the users resource, such as its size and modification date.\n\n**HTTP\/2**\n\nHTTP\/2 is a binary protocol, which means it uses binary data instead of text-based data. This allows for more efficient communication between the client and server. The main methods of HTTP\/2 are similar to those of HTTP\/1.1, but with some differences:\n\n1. **GET**: Same as in HTTP\/1.1, retrieves a resource from the server.\n\n2. **POST**: Same as in HTTP\/1.1, creates a new resource on the server.\n\n3. **PUT**: Same as in HTTP\/1.1, updates an existing resource on the server.\n\n4. **DELETE**: Same as in HTTP\/1.1, deletes a resource from the server.\n\n5. **OPTIONS**: Returns the HTTP methods supported by the server for a particular resource.\n\nRole: Retrieve the HTTP methods supported by the server for a particular resource.\n\nExample: `OPTIONS \/users` returns the HTTP methods supported by the server for the users resource.\n\nNote that HTTP\/2 also introduces new features such as multiplexing, which allows multiple requests and responses to be sent over a single connection, and server push, which allows the server to push resources to the client without the client requesting them.","😊\n\nIn HTTP, both `PUT` and `PATCH` are used to update a resource on the server, but they have different semantics and use cases.\n\n**PUT**\n\n`PUT` is used to replace an entire resource with a new version. When you send a `PUT` request, you're essentially saying, \"Here's the new version of the resource, replace the old one with this.\"\n\nHere are some key characteristics of `PUT`:\n\n* **Replace entire resource**: The client sends the entire resource, and the server replaces the old resource with the new one.\n* **Idempotent**: `PUT` is idempotent, meaning that making the same request multiple times will have the same effect as making it once. This is because each request contains the entire resource, so repeating the request won't change the outcome.\n* **Example**: `PUT \/users\/1` with a JSON payload containing the entire user object, including all fields, will replace the entire user resource with the new data.\n\n**PATCH**\n\n`PATCH` is used to partially update a resource. When you send a `PATCH` request, you're saying, \"Here's the update to the resource, apply these changes to the existing resource.\"\n\nHere are some key characteristics of `PATCH`:\n\n* **Partial update**: The client sends only the changes to be applied to the resource, and the server updates the resource accordingly.\n* **Not idempotent**: `PATCH` is not idempotent, meaning that making the same request multiple times can have different effects. This is because each request only contains the changes, so repeating the request can accumulate changes.\n* **Example**: `PATCH \/users\/1` with a JSON payload containing only the updated fields, such as `{\"name\": \"New Name\"}`, will update only the `name` field of the user resource.\n\nIn summary:\n\n* Use `PUT` when you want to replace an entire resource with a new version.\n* Use `PATCH` when you want to partially update a resource with specific changes.\n\nWhile both methods can be used for updating resources, `PUT` is more suitable for scenarios where you need to replace the entire resource, whereas `PATCH` is better suited for scenarios where you need to make incremental changes to a resource."],"references":["GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, HEAD, TRACE, CONNECT 중 5개를 설명","PUT은 전체를 업데이트하는 반면, PATCH는 일부를 업데이트한다."]}

We create an empty dictionary `char_count` to keep track of the count of each character in the input list.\n2. We iterate through the input list, and for each character, we increment its count in the dictionary. If the character is not already in the dictionary, we set its count to 1.\n3. We iterate through the input list again, and for each character, we check if its count is 1. If it is, we return that character, since it is the first unique character we've found.\n4. If we reach the end of the list without finding a unique character, we return `None`.\n\nHere are some test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior:\n```\nprint(find_unique_character(['a', 'b', 'c', 'a', 'd']))  # Output: 'b'\nprint(find_unique_character(['a', 'b', 'a', 'b', 'c']))  # Output: 'c'\nprint(find_unique_character(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']))  # Output: 'a'\nprint(find_unique_character(['a', 'a', 'b', 'b', 'c']))  # Output: 'c'\nprint(find_unique_character(['a', 'a', 'a', 'b', 'b']))  # Output: None\n```\nNote that the function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input list, since we iterate through the list twice. If you need a more efficient solution, you can use a different approach, such as using a `set` to keep track of unique characters.","Here are some ways to increase the difficulty of the problem:\n\n1. **Large input size**: Instead of a small list of characters, the input list could contain thousands or millions of characters. This would require the function to be optimized for performance and efficiency.\n2. **Multiple unique characters**: Instead of returning the first unique character, the function could be required to return all unique characters in the list. This would require the function to keep track of multiple unique characters and return them in a specific order (e.g., alphabetical order).\n3. **Case insensitivity**: The function could be required to ignore case when checking for uniqueness, so that 'A' and 'a' are considered the same character.\n4. **Non-alphabetic characters**: The input list could contain non-alphabetic characters such as numbers, punctuation, or special characters, which would need to be handled correctly by the function.\n5. **Unicode characters**: The input could contain Unicode characters, which would require the function to handle Unicode correctly.\n6. **Streaming input**: Instead of receiving the entire list of characters at once, the function could receive the characters one at a time, and would need to process them in a streaming fashion.\n7. **Limited memory**: The function could be required to operate within a limited amount of memory, which would require it to use efficient data structures and algorithms.\n8. **Real-time constraints**: The function could be required to return the unique character within a certain time limit, which would require it to be optimized for performance and efficiency.\n9. **Error handling**: The function could be required to handle errors and exceptions, such as invalid input or out-of-memory errors.\n10. **Multi-threading**: The function could be required to operate in a multi-threaded environment, which would require it to be thread-safe and able to handle concurrent access to shared data structures.\n\nHere are some example problem statements that incorporate these difficulties:\n\n* \"Write a function that takes a list of 1 million characters as input and returns all unique characters in alphabetical order, ignoring case and non-alphabetic characters.\"\n* \"Write a function that takes a stream of characters as input and returns the first unique character, using no more than 1MB of memory.\"\n* \"Write a function that takes a list of Unicode characters as input and returns the first unique character, handling errors and exceptions correctly.\"\n\nThese are just a few examples, but you can mix and match these difficulties to create a problem that is challenging and interesting for the solver."],"references":[null,null]}

One of the most distinctive features of Bibimbap is its vibrant presentation, with an assortment of colorful vegetables, meat (usually beef), and a fried egg arranged artfully on top of a bed of white rice.\n\nThe flavor of Bibimbap is a perfect harmony of sweet, savory, and spicy notes. The combination of sautéed vegetables, such as zucchini, carrots, and mushrooms, with the savory flavor of beef and the richness of the fried egg, creates a depth of flavor that is both satisfying and refreshing. The spicy kick from the gochujang sauce, a traditional Korean chili paste, adds an extra layer of excitement to the dish. When all the ingredients are mixed together, the flavors meld together in a delightful symphony that will leave you wanting more.\n\nOne of the best things about Bibimbap is its versatility. You can customize the dish to your liking by adding or subtracting ingredients, making it a great option for vegetarians, vegans, and meat-lovers alike. The recipe is also surprisingly easy to follow, requiring only a few simple ingredients and some basic cooking skills. To make a classic Bibimbap, start by cooking a pot of white rice and preparing a variety of vegetables, such as bean sprouts, shiitake mushrooms, and zucchini. Then, cook a small amount of beef in a pan with some oil and soy sauce, and fry an egg in a separate pan. Finally, assemble all the ingredients in a bowl and add a drizzle of gochujang sauce and a sprinkle of sesame seeds.\n\nDespite its simplicity, Bibimbap is a dish that requires some skill and attention to detail. The key to a great Bibimbap is to cook each ingredient to perfection, so that the vegetables are crisp and tender, the beef is juicy and flavorful, and the egg is cooked to a perfect runny yolk. The presentation is also crucial, as the arrangement of the ingredients can make or break the dish. With a little practice and patience, however, you can create a stunning and delicious Bibimbap that will impress even the most discerning palates.\n\nIn conclusion, Bibimbap is a dish that has it all - flavor, nutrition, and visual appeal. Whether you're a foodie, a health enthusiast, or simply a lover of good food, Bibimbap is a must-try dish that is sure to delight and inspire.

This is probably the most common and widely used meaning of the word.\n2. **Apology**: In Korean culture, \"사과\" also means \"apology\" or \"to apologize\". When someone says \"사과합니다\" (sagwa hamnida), it means \"I apologize\" or \"I'm sorry\". This meaning is deeply rooted in Korean etiquette and is often used in formal and informal settings to express remorse or regret.\n\nThese two meanings may seem unrelated, but they both stem from the same Chinese character \"果\" (gwǎ), which means \"fruit\" or \"result\". In Korean, the word \"사과\" has evolved to encompass both the literal meaning of \"apple\" and the figurative meaning of \"apology\", which is often seen as a way to \"bear fruit\" or take responsibility for one's actions.","😊\n\nIn linguistics, there are two related but distinct concepts: 동음이의어 (dong-eum-i-ui-eo) and 다의어 (da-ui-eo). Both refer to words with multiple meanings, but they differ in how those meanings are related.\n\n**동음이의어 (Dong-eum-i-ui-eo)**:\n\n* Literally means \"same sound, different meaning\"\n* Refers to words that are pronounced the same but have different meanings and often different characters or origins\n* The meanings are not necessarily related, and the words may have different etymologies\n* Examples:.bank (financial institution) and bank (riverbank), or bow (front of a ship) and bow (ribbon tied around a package)\n\n**다의어 (Da-ui-eo)**:\n\n* Literally means \"multiple meaning\"\n* Refers to words that have multiple related meanings, often with a shared core meaning or etymology\n* The meanings are often connected through metaphorical extensions, figurative language, or semantic shifts\n* Examples: head (top of the body) and head (leader or chief), or heart (organ) and heart (emotional center)\n\nTo illustrate the difference, consider the Korean word \"사과\" (sagwa) again:\n\n* As a 동음이의어, \"사과\" has two distinct meanings: \"apple\" and \"apology\". These meanings are not directly related, and the word has different characters and origins for each meaning.\n* As a 다의어, \"사과\" has multiple related meanings, such as \"fruit\" (including apples) and \"result\" or \"consequence\" (leading to the meaning of \"apology\"). These meanings are connected through a shared core meaning or etymology.\n\nWhile both concepts deal with words having multiple meanings, 동음이의어 emphasizes the distinctness of the meanings, whereas 다의어 highlights the connections and relationships between them."],"references":["아래 뜻 중 두 가지 이상 언급했으면 정답으로 인정.\n1. 자기의 잘못을 인정하고 용서를 빎. 2.
