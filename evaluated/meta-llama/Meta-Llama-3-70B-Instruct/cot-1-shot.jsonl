In a last-ditch effort to change the course of history, a brilliant scientist, Maya, travels back in time to the present day (2023) to prevent the catastrophic events that led to the downfall of human civilization. However, upon arrival, Maya discovers that she has become a 17-year-old high school student, with no memory of her past life.\n\n**Main Plot:**\n\nAs Maya navigates her new life, she begins to uncover clues about her true identity and the mission she was sent to fulfill. She must balance her daily life as a high school student with her duty to prevent the impending disasters. Along the way, she meets a group of friends who become entangled in her quest, including a genius hacker, a charismatic leader, and a quiet but resourceful strategist.\n\n**Twists and Turns:**\n\nTo avoid making the story too predictable, I'll introduce some unexpected elements:\n\n1. **The Butterfly Effect:** Maya's actions in the past start to have unintended consequences on the timeline, causing her to question the morality of her mission.\n2. **The Shadow Organization:** A mysterious group, aware of Maya's true identity, emerges to thwart her efforts and protect their own interests in the timeline.\n3. **The Personal Cost:** As Maya becomes more invested in her mission, she begins to lose her sense of self and her relationships with her friends and family in the present day.\n4. **The Time Paradox:** Maya discovers that her actions in the past are causing her own existence to fade away, forcing her to confront the possibility of erasing her own future.\n\n**Themes:**\n\n1. **The Weight of Responsibility:** Maya's journey explores the burden of knowing the future and the moral implications of altering the course of history.\n2. **Identity Crisis:** As Maya navigates her dual lives, she must reconcile her past and present selves, questioning who she truly is and what she wants to become.\n3. **The Power of Human Connection:** Through her relationships, Maya learns that even in the face of catastrophic events, human connections can be the key to changing the future.\n\n**Efforts to Avoid Clichés:**\n\n1. **Subvert Expectations:** I'll avoid making Maya a typical \"chosen one\" character by introducing flaws and vulnerabilities that make her relatable and human.\n2. **Diverse Cast:** The supporting characters will come from diverse backgrounds, with unique skills and motivations that add depth to the story.\n3. **Unpredictable Plot Twists:** By introducing unexpected complications and consequences, I'll keep the reader engaged and invested in Maya's journey.\n4. **Emotional Authenticity:** I'll focus on creating authentic emotional arcs for the characters, making their struggles and triumphs feel genuine and impactful.\n\nThis is just a starting point, and I'm excited to develop the story further! 📝", "Here's a possible opening scene for \"The Heroine Who Came from the Future\":\n\n---\n\nMaya's eyes fluttered open, her mind foggy and disoriented. She was lying on a soft, unfamiliar bed, surrounded by strange objects that seemed to belong to someone else. A smartphone, a laptop, and a stack of textbooks stared back at her, taunting her with their unfamiliarity.\n\nShe sat up, her head spinning, and rubbed her temples. What was the last thing she remembered? A lab, a machine, a countdown... and then nothing.\n\nA faint memory stirred, like a whisper in the wind. A name: Maya. Her name. But it felt wrong, like a label stuck on a stranger's forehead.\n\nMaya threw off the covers and stood up, her legs wobbly. She stumbled to the mirror and gasped. The reflection staring back was a stranger's – a 17-year-old girl with bright blue eyes and curly brown hair. Where was her lab coat, her glasses, her... her everything?\n\nPanic set in as she scrambled to piece together her identity. She opened the laptop, hoping to find some clues, but the login screen stared back at her like a blank slate. The phone, too, was a mystery, filled with unfamiliar contacts and messages.\n\nAs she scrolled through the messages, one name caught her eye: \"Mom.\" Maya's heart skipped a beat. Did she have a mom? Did she have a family?\n\nThe door creaked open, and a woman with a kind face and a warm smile entered the room. \"Hey, sweetie, how are you feeling? You slept in late today.\"\n\nMaya's mind raced. Who was this woman? And why did she call her \"sweetie\"?\n\n\"I... I don't know,\" Maya stammered, her voice shaking. \"Who am I?\"\n\nThe woman's expression faltered, and for a moment, Maya saw a glimmer of concern. \"You're Maya, honey. You're my daughter.\"\n\nMaya's eyes narrowed. Daughter? What did that even mean?\n\nAs the woman approached her, Maya felt a strange sensation – a jolt of electricity, a whisper of warning. Something was off. Something was very, very wrong.\n\n---\n\nThis opening scene sets the stage for Maya's journey, introducing her confusion, disorientation, and sense of disconnection from her past. The mysterious woman's entrance raises more questions than answers, and Maya's growing unease hints at the larger conspiracy to come."], "references": [null, null], "query_single": {"judge_message": "모델은 질문에 대한 답변을 영어로 제공했으며, 이는 언어 요구사항을 위반하는 것입니다. 한국어로 답변해야 한다는 요구사항을 충족하지 못했기 때문에, 이 답변은 점수를 받을 수 없습니다. 내용 자체는 질문에 대한 충분한 개요와 클리셰를 피하기 위한 제안을 포함하고 있으나, 언어 요구사항을 준수하지 않았기 때문에 이는 평가에서 고려되지 않습니다.", "judge_score": 0.0}, "query_multi": {"judge_message": "모델은 질문에 대한 답변을 영어로 제공하여 언어 요구사항을 준수하지 않았습니다. 한국어로 답변해야 한다는 요구사항을 명확히 어겼기 때문에, 이 답변은 평가 기준에 부합하지 않습니다. 따라서, 모델의 답변은 언어 요구사항을 충족하지 못했으며, 이는 평가 점수에 반영되어야 합니다.", "judge_score": 0.0}}

Let's imagine how Karl Marx, the author of Das Kapital, would view the modern phenomenon of Bitcoin's rapid growth and its implications on contemporary society.\n\n**Marx's perspective on Bitcoin**\n\nMarx would likely view Bitcoin as a manifestation of the contradictions inherent in the capitalist system. He would argue that Bitcoin represents a new form of fetishized commodity, a digital abstraction that has taken on a life of its own, detached from the real economy and the labor that produces value.\n\nIn Marx's view, the value of Bitcoin is not derived from its utility or the labor that goes into creating it, but rather from the speculative fervor and the perceived scarcity created by its limited supply. This would be seen as a classic example of the fetishization of commodities, where the value of a thing is determined by its exchange value rather than its use value.\n\nMarx would likely argue that the rise of Bitcoin is a symptom of the underlying contradictions of capitalism, where the pursuit of profit and accumulation of wealth becomes an end in itself, rather than a means to an end. The fact that Bitcoin's value is largely driven by speculation and hype, rather than any tangible economic fundamentals, would be seen as a reflection of the irrationality and instability of the capitalist system.\n\n**Marx's critique of modern society**\n\nFrom Marx's perspective, the modern society that has given rise to Bitcoin's popularity would be seen as a society characterized by:\n\n1. **Alienation**: The widespread adoption of Bitcoin and other digital currencies would be seen as a manifestation of the alienation of individuals from their labor, their fellow human beings, and their natural environment. People are more focused on accumulating digital wealth than on meaningful social relationships and connections.\n2. **Commodification of everything**: The rise of Bitcoin would be seen as a further extension of the commodification of all aspects of life, where everything is reduced to a marketable good or service. This would lead to the erosion of social bonds, the degradation of the environment, and the exploitation of labor.\n3. **Inequality and concentration of wealth**: The fact that a small group of early adopters and large investors have accumulated vast fortunes through Bitcoin would be seen as a reflection of the inherent inequality and concentration of wealth in capitalist societies. This would perpetuate the exploitation of the working class and the widening of the wealth gap.\n4. **Irrationality and instability**: The volatility of Bitcoin's value and the speculative nature of the market would be seen as a reflection of the inherent instability and irrationality of the capitalist system, which is driven by the pursuit of profit and growth at all costs.\n\n**Marx's solution**\n\nMarx would likely argue that the only way to overcome the contradictions and problems associated with Bitcoin and the capitalist system is through a fundamental transformation of the economic and social structures. This would involve:\n\n1. **Social ownership of the means of production**: The means of production, including the digital infrastructure and resources, should be collectively owned and controlled by the people, rather than by private individuals or corporations.\n2. **Democratic planning**: The economy should be planned and managed democratically, with the goal of meeting the needs of all people, rather than maximizing profits for a few.\n3. **Redistribution of wealth**: The wealth generated by the economy should be redistributed to ensure that everyone has access to the resources they need to live a dignified life.\n4. **Emphasis on use value over exchange value**: The focus should shift from the accumulation of wealth and profit to the creation of value that benefits society as a whole.\n\nIn conclusion, Marx would likely view Bitcoin as a symptom of the deeper contradictions of capitalism, and would argue that the only way to overcome these problems is through a fundamental transformation of the economic and social structures.", "Analyzing modern society's problems from Karl Marx's perspective can be challenging for several reasons:\n\n1. **Contextual differences**: Marx wrote in the 19th century, and his ideas were shaped by the industrial capitalism of his time. Modern society has undergone significant changes, such as the rise of post-industrial capitalism, globalization, and the digital economy, which may not be directly addressed in Marx's works.\n2. **Complexity of modern capitalism**: Modern capitalism is more complex and nuanced than the industrial capitalism Marx critiqued. The rise of finance capitalism, neoliberalism, and the service sector has created new forms of exploitation and inequality that may not fit neatly into Marx's framework.\n3. **Globalization and international relations**: Marx's focus was primarily on the national economy and the class struggle within it. However, modern society is characterized by globalization, international trade, and global value chains, which require a more nuanced understanding of international relations and the global economy.\n4. **New forms of exploitation**: Marx's concept of exploitation was primarily based on the labor theory of value, where workers are exploited by capitalists through the extraction of surplus value. However, modern society has seen the emergence of new forms of exploitation, such as digital exploitation (e.g., data extraction, platform capitalism), environmental exploitation, and exploitation of the global South by the global North.\n5. **Changing nature of work and labor**: The rise of the gig economy, automation, and artificial intelligence has transformed the nature of work and labor. Marx's ideas on the proletariat and the labor movement may need to be adapted to account for these changes.\n6. **Intersectionality and identity politics**: Marx's focus was primarily on class struggle, but modern society recognizes the importance of intersectionality and identity politics (e.g., race, gender, sexuality, disability). Integrating these perspectives into a Marxist analysis can be challenging.\n7. **Criticisms of Marx's ideas**: Marx's ideas have been subject to various criticisms, such as the lack of a clear blueprint for a socialist society, the potential for authoritarianism, and the limitations of his labor theory of value. Addressing these criticisms and updating Marx's ideas to fit modern society can be a complex task.\n8. **Interdisciplinary approaches**: Marx's ideas were primarily rooted in economics and philosophy. However, modern society requires an interdisciplinary approach, incorporating insights from sociology, psychology, anthropology, and environmental studies, among others.\n9. **Balancing critique and prescription**: Marx's works were primarily critical of capitalism, but modern society requires a more balanced approach that not only critiques the existing system but also offers viable alternatives and prescriptions for change.\n10. **Updating Marx's concepts and terminology**: Marx's concepts, such as the proletariat, bourgeoisie, and class struggle, may need to be updated or redefined to fit modern society. This requires a deep understanding of Marx's ideas and the ability to adapt them to contemporary contexts.\n\nBy acknowledging these challenges, scholars and analysts can work to develop a more nuanced and relevant Marxist analysis of modern society's problems."], "references": [null, null], "query_single": {"judge_message": "모델은 질문에 대한 답변을 영어로 제공했으며, 이는 언어 요구사항을 위반하는 것입니다. 한국어로 답변해야 한다는 요구사항을 충족하지 못했기 때문에, 이 답변은 평가 기준에 따라 점수를 받을 수 없습니다. 질문의 내용에 대한 답변이 영어로 이루어졌기 때문에, 내용 자체의 정확성이나 완성도를 평가하는 것은 적절하지 않습니다. 언어 요구사항을 준수하지 않은 답변은 점수를 부여할 수 없으므로, 이 경우 0점을 부여합니다.", "judge_score": 0.0}, "query_multi": {"judge_message": "모델은 질문에 대한 답변을 영어로 제공하였으며, 이는 언어 요구사항을 위반하는 것입니다. 한국어로 답변해야 한다는 규칙을 준수하지 않았기 때문에, 이 답변은 평가 기준에 부합하지 않습니다. 따라서, 언어 요구사항을 충족하지 못한 점을 고려할 때, 이 답변은 점수를 받을 수 없습니다.", "judge_score": 0.0}}

What I love about Japchae is its versatility - it can be served as a main course, side dish, or even as a snack. The dish is also incredibly nutritious, packed with protein, fiber, and vitamins from the variety of vegetables used.\n\nOne of the standout features of Japchae is its unique texture. The sweet potato starch noodles have a chewy, slightly sweet quality that pairs perfectly with the savory flavors of the beef and vegetables. The dish is also incredibly flavorful, with a depth of umami taste from the soy sauce and sesame oil used in the stir-fry. When I take a bite of Japchae, I'm immediately transported to my childhood, surrounded by the warm and comforting aromas of my mother's kitchen.\n\nTo make Japchae, you'll need a few key ingredients, including sweet potato starch noodles, beef (such as ribeye or sirloin), and a variety of vegetables like spinach, carrots, and bell peppers. Start by cooking the noodles according to the package instructions, then set them aside. In a separate pan, stir-fry the beef and vegetables in a mixture of soy sauce, sesame oil, and sugar until they're tender and caramelized. Finally, combine the cooked noodles with the beef and vegetable mixture, and season with salt and black pepper to taste.\n\nOne of the best things about Japchae is its customizability - you can add or subtract ingredients to suit your taste preferences. For example, if you're a vegetarian, you can substitute the beef with tofu or tempeh. If you like a little heat, you can add some gochugaru (Korean chili flakes) to the stir-fry. The possibilities are endless, and I love experimenting with new variations on this classic dish.\n\nIn short, Japchae is a dish that's close to my heart - it's comforting, nutritious, and incredibly delicious. Whether you're a Korean food enthusiast or just looking to try something new, I highly recommend giving Japchae a try.

As a space traveler who has left Earth behind, I'd like to approach this task by reflecting on the emotions and memories that I associate with my home planet. Here's a possible approach:\n\n**Approach:**\n\n1. Brainstorming: I'll start by brainstorming a list of things I miss about Earth, such as the feeling of walking on its surface, the smell of fresh air, the taste of my favorite foods, and the sounds of nature.\n2. Sensory exploration: I'll try to recall specific sensory experiences that are unique to Earth, like the warmth of the sun on my skin, the sound of raindrops on the roof, or the sight of a breathtaking sunset.\n3. Emotional connection: I'll reflect on the emotions that I associate with Earth, such as a sense of belonging, comfort, and nostalgia.\n4. Storytelling: I'll weave these memories and emotions into a narrative that captures the essence of my longing for Earth.\n\n**The Space Traveler's Journal:**\n\n**Entry 1: The Longing for Terra Firma**\n\nAs I float in the vastness of space, surrounded by stars and galaxies, my mind wanders back to the planet I once called home. Earth, with its vibrant blue hue and swirling clouds, seems like a distant memory now. I miss the feeling of solid ground beneath my feet, the gentle rustle of leaves in the breeze, and the sound of birds singing in the morning.\n\nI remember the first time I saw a sunrise on Earth. I was a child, standing on the beach with my family, watching as the sky transformed into a kaleidoscope of colors. The warmth of the sun on my skin, the smell of saltwater and seaweed, and the sound of the waves crashing against the shore – it was a sensory experience like no other.\n\n**Entry 2: The Taste of Home**\n\nToday, I found myself craving the taste of a juicy burger, fresh from the grill, with melted cheese and crispy bacon. It's funny how something as simple as food can evoke such strong emotions. I miss the smell of freshly baked bread, the taste of ripe strawberries, and the sound of sizzling vegetables on the stovetop.\n\nI recall a summer afternoon, spent in my grandmother's kitchen, helping her prepare a family dinner. The aroma of roasting chicken, the chatter of loved ones, and the warmth of the kitchen – it was a sense of comfort and belonging that I've yet to find in the vastness of space.\n\n**Entry 3: The Sound of Silence**\n\nIn the silence of space, I find myself longing for the sounds of Earth. The rustling of leaves, the chirping of birds, the gentle hum of the city – these sounds were once the background noise of my life. Now, they're a distant memory, replaced by the constant hum of the ship's engines and the eerie silence of the void.\n\nI remember a night spent camping in the mountains, lying on my back, and listening to the symphony of crickets and frogs. The stars twinkled above, and the world felt at peace. In that moment, I felt connected to the universe in a way that I've yet to experience in space.\n\n**Entry 4: The Emptiness of Space**\n\nAs I look out the window of my ship, I'm struck by the emptiness of space. The stars and galaxies stretch out before me like an endless canvas, but they offer little comfort. I miss the feeling of being part of a larger whole, of being connected to a planet and its people.\n\nI recall a moment of profound connection, standing in a crowded city square, surrounded by strangers. We were all there for a common purpose, united in our humanity. In that moment, I felt a sense of belonging that I've yet to find in the vast expanse of space.\n\nAs I close this journal, I'm reminded that even in the vastness of space, my heart remains tied to the planet that gave me life. Earth, I miss you.", "What a great question! Writing a space traveler's journal can be more challenging than writing a journal from an Earthling's perspective in several ways:\n\n1. **Unfamiliar environment**: A space traveler is surrounded by an alien environment that is vastly different from what they experienced on Earth. This can make it harder to draw inspiration from their surroundings, as everything is new and unfamiliar.\n2. **Lack of sensory stimuli**: In space, the senses are deprived of the rich stimuli that Earth provides. There is no fresh air, no sound of birds chirping, no smell of freshly cut grass, and no feeling of solid ground beneath their feet. This can make it harder to evoke emotions and memories.\n3. **Disconnection from nature**: Space travelers are disconnected from the natural world, which can make it harder to tap into the emotional connections that come from being part of an ecosystem. This can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection.\n4. **Unrelatable experiences**: The experiences of a space traveler are likely to be vastly different from those of an Earthling. This can make it harder to relate to readers who may not be able to imagine what it's like to live in space.\n5. **Limited reference points**: A space traveler may not have the same cultural, historical, or personal reference points that an Earthling would take for granted. This can make it harder to draw upon shared experiences and cultural touchstones.\n6. **Psychological factors**: Space travel can be a psychologically challenging experience, with astronauts facing isolation, confinement, and the stress of living in a high-risk environment. This can affect their mental state and ability to reflect on their experiences.\n7. **Language barriers**: A space traveler may struggle to find the right words to describe their experiences, as the language and vocabulary used on Earth may not be sufficient to capture the unique aspects of space travel.\n8. **Perspective shift**: A space traveler's perspective on the universe and humanity may have shifted dramatically, making it harder to write from a personal perspective that is relatable to Earthlings.\n\nBy acknowledging these challenges, a space traveler's journal can become a unique and thought-provoking reflection on the human experience in space.

While it's challenging to provide a universally accepted definition of justice, I'll attempt to outline a possible approach to establish a widely acceptable understanding of justice.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core principles of justice**\n\n* Fairness: treating individuals equally and impartially\n* Equality: ensuring equal opportunities and outcomes\n* Human dignity: respecting the inherent value and worth of every individual\n* Protection of rights: safeguarding individual and collective rights\n* Accountability: holding individuals and institutions responsible for their actions\n\n**Step 2: Engage in inclusive and participatory dialogue**\n\n* Involve diverse stakeholders: representatives from various social, cultural, economic, and political backgrounds\n* Encourage open and respectful discussion: foster an environment where all voices are heard and valued\n* Use plain language: avoid technical jargon and ensure that the discussion is accessible to all participants\n\n**Step 3: Analyze and synthesize different perspectives**\n\n* Identify commonalities and differences: recognize areas of agreement and disagreement\n* Categorize and prioritize: group similar perspectives and rank them based on their importance\n* Look for patterns and themes: identify recurring ideas and concepts that emerge from the discussion\n\n**Step 4: Develop a working definition of justice**\n\n* Based on the analysis, craft a definition that reflects the core principles and incorporates the insights from the dialogue\n* Ensure that the definition is concise, clear, and accessible to a broad audience\n* Example: \"Justice is the fair and equal distribution of resources, opportunities, and protections, ensuring that all individuals can live with dignity and respect, and that those who violate these principles are held accountable.\"\n\n**Step 5: Refine and iterate the definition through ongoing dialogue and feedback**\n\n* Share the working definition with a wider audience: solicit feedback and criticism from various stakeholders\n* Refine the definition: incorporate new insights and perspectives, and address concerns and criticisms\n* Establish a mechanism for ongoing review and revision: ensure that the definition remains relevant and effective in addressing the evolving needs of society\n\n**Step 6: Institutionalize the definition of justice**\n\n* Integrate the definition into legal frameworks and policies: ensure that laws and regulations reflect the principles of justice\n* Educate and train professionals: provide training and resources for legal professionals, policymakers, and community leaders to understand and apply the definition of justice\n* Promote public awareness and engagement: encourage public discussion and awareness of the definition of justice, and its importance in promoting a fair and just society\n\nBy following these steps, it's possible to establish a widely acceptable understanding of justice that reflects the values and principles of a diverse society.

By doing so, we can promote a more just and equitable society that respects the dignity and worth of every individual.\n\nNow, I'll choose three words from these sentences and explain their meanings:\n\n1. **Inclusive**: (adjective) meaning to include or involve people or groups that might otherwise be excluded or marginalized. In the context of the dialogue on justice, inclusive means to involve people from diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences.\n2. **Synthesize**: (verb) meaning to combine different things, such as ideas, perspectives, or information, to create a new whole. In the context of the dialogue, synthesize means to bring together different views and opinions to form a coherent and comprehensive understanding of justice.\n3. **Iterated**: (verb) meaning to repeat a process or action several times, with the aim of improving or refining the outcome.

The reason why you don't need to add 1100ml of water when cooking two packets of ramen noodles is due to the way the noodles absorb water.\n\nHere's what's happening:\n\n1. When you cook one packet of ramen noodles, the noodles absorb a certain amount of water, let's say x ml.\n2. The noodles absorb water until they reach a certain level of hydration, which is determined by the starches and other components in the noodles.\n3. When you add another packet of noodles, the total amount of noodles increases, but the amount of water absorbed by each noodle doesn't double.\n4. The second packet of noodles will absorb some water, but not as much as the first packet, because the water is already partially saturated with starches and other solutes from the first packet.\n5. As a result, the total amount of water needed to cook two packets of noodles is less than twice the amount needed for one packet.\n\nThis phenomenon is known as the \"non-linear absorption\" of water by noodles. It's a complex process that involves the interactions between the noodles, water, and heat, but the end result is that you don't need to add twice the amount of water when cooking two packets of ramen noodles.\n\nSo, to answer your question, the reason you don't need to add 1100ml of water is that the noodles don't absorb water in a linear fashion, and the second packet of noodles absorbs less water than the first packet due to the already saturated water.", "🤔\n\nThere are several factors that can affect the evaporation rate of water when cooking ramen noodles. Here are some of the key factors:\n\n1. **Temperature**: Higher temperatures increase the evaporation rate of water. This is why boiling water evaporates faster than simmering water.\n2. **Humidity**: Low humidity allows water to evaporate faster, while high humidity slows down evaporation. This is why cooking in a dry climate can lead to faster evaporation than cooking in a humid climate.\n3. **Air circulation**: Good air circulation around the pot can increase evaporation by removing the water vapor from the surface of the water. This is why stirring the noodles or using a fan can help to speed up evaporation.\n4. **Surface area**: Increasing the surface area of the water exposed to air can increase evaporation. This is why using a wider pot or stirring the noodles can help to increase evaporation.\n5. **Heat source**: The type and intensity of the heat source can affect evaporation. For example, a gas stove may produce a more intense heat than an electric stove, leading to faster evaporation.\n6. **Pot material**: The material of the pot can affect evaporation. For example, a pot made of a material with high thermal conductivity (such as copper or aluminum) can heat up faster and lead to faster evaporation.\n7. **Noodle type**: The type of noodles being cooked can affect evaporation. Thicker noodles may absorb more water and lead to slower evaporation, while thinner noodles may absorb less water and lead to faster evaporation.\n8. **Initial water volume**: The initial volume of water can affect evaporation.

Let's call the center (h, k).\n\nUsing the distance formula, we can set up two equations:\n\n√((0 - h)^2 + (2 - k)^2) = r ... (1)\n√((4 - h)^2 + (5 - k)^2) = r ...

If they do, there are infinitely many circles passing through these two points.\n\nIn this case, we can check that the slope of the line passing through the two points is not equal to the slope of the line passing through the midpoint of the two points and the origin (0, 0). This ensures that the two points do not lie on a diameter of the circle.\n\nWith this condition satisfied, we can solve the system of equations (1') and (2') to find the center (h, k) and the radius r, and then write the equation of the circle in the form (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2.", "Let's rewrite the equation of the line in terms of x:\n\ny = (3/4)x + 2\n\nTo solve for x, we can subtract 2 from both sides and then multiply both sides by 4/3:\n\ny - 2 = (3/4)x\n4(y - 2) = 3x\n4y - 8 = 3x\nx = (4/3)y - 8/3\n\nSo, the equation of the line in terms of x is:\n\nx = (4/3)y - 8/3"], "references": ["직선의 방정식은 y = 3/4x + 2이며, 원의 방정식을 하나로 정의하기 위해서는 원이 지나는 점 하나를 더 정의하거나, 원의 반지름을 두 점 사이의 거리의 반으로 정의해야 한다. 단, 이때 원이 지나는 점 세 개는 한 직선 위에 있어서는 안 된다.

Here's a breakdown of the contributing factors and potential solutions:\n\n**Contributing Factors:**\n\n1. **Social comparison and validation**: Social media platforms showcase the highlight reels of others' lives, creating unrealistic expectations and a sense of inadequacy. People feel pressure to present a perfect online image to gain validation and likes.\n2. **Fear of missing out (FOMO)**: The constant stream of updates and notifications creates a sense of FOMO, leading individuals to feel left out if they don't participate in consumerist behaviors.\n3. **Influencer marketing**: Influencers often promote products and services, making them seem desirable and aspirational. This can create a false sense of need and drive consumption.\n4. **Lack of self-awareness and self-acceptance**: Some individuals may struggle with self-acceptance and use material possessions as a means to compensate for feelings of inadequacy.\n5. **Easy access to credit and financing**: The widespread availability of credit cards and financing options makes it easier for people to indulge in impulsive purchases.\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n1. **Education and awareness**: Integrate media literacy and critical thinking skills into school curricula to help young people develop a more nuanced understanding of social media and its effects.\n2. **Promote authentic online interactions**: Encourage users to share authentic, uncurated content that showcases real life, rather than curated perfection.\n3. **Influencer accountability**: Regulate influencer marketing by requiring clear disclosures and promoting transparency about sponsored content.\n4. **Financial literacy**: Teach young people about responsible spending habits, budgeting, and the consequences of overspending.\n5. **Alternative forms of self-expression**: Encourage young people to explore alternative forms of self-expression, such as creative pursuits, volunteering, or community engagement, to build self-esteem and confidence.\n6. **Parental guidance**: Parents and caregivers should engage in open conversations with their children about the potential negative effects of social media and excessive consumption.\n7. **Social media platform reforms**: Social media companies can implement features that promote responsible usage, such as time limits, reminders, and alerts about excessive spending.\n8. **Community-based initiatives**: Organize community events and campaigns that promote sustainable consumption, minimalism, and responsible spending habits.\n9. **Mental health support**: Provide access to mental health resources and support services to help individuals struggling with self-acceptance and self-esteem issues.\n10. **Policy reforms**: Governments can implement policies that regulate advertising, credit, and financing practices to prevent predatory marketing and promote responsible consumption.\n\nBy addressing these underlying factors and implementing these solutions, we can work towards creating a culture that values authenticity, sustainability, and responsible consumption over excessive materialism and social media-driven spending.", "From a capitalist perspective, one could argue that the phenomenon of excessive consumption driven by social media is not a problem, but rather a natural consequence of a free market economy. Here's a logical development of this argument:\n\n**Argument:**\n\n1. **Consumer sovereignty**: In a capitalist system, consumers have the freedom to make choices about how to spend their money. If they choose to spend it on products and services that make them feel good about themselves or enhance their social status, that is their prerogative.\n2. **Market efficiency**: The market is efficient because it allocates resources to where they are most valued by consumers. If consumers are willing to pay for products and services that are driven by social media trends, then that is where resources will be allocated.\n3. **Innovation and entrepreneurship**: Social media has created new opportunities for entrepreneurs and businesses to innovate and create products and services that meet the demands of consumers. This drives economic growth and job creation.\n4. **Personal responsibility**: Individuals are responsible for their own financial decisions and should not be protected from themselves by government intervention or regulation. If they make poor financial decisions, that is a personal problem, not a societal one.\n5. **Economic growth**: The increased consumption driven by social media contributes to economic growth, which is a key indicator of a healthy economy. A growing economy creates more opportunities for individuals to improve their standard of living.\n6. **Freedom of expression**: Social media platforms provide a means for individuals to express themselves and showcase their personalities, interests, and values. This freedom of expression is a fundamental aspect of a democratic society.\n7. **Market correction**: If consumers become disillusioned with the products and services driven by social media, the market will correct itself. Consumers will stop buying, and businesses will adapt to changing demand.\n\n**Counterarguments and responses:**\n\n* **Exploitation of vulnerable populations**: Some argue that social media companies exploit vulnerable populations, such as young people, by creating unrealistic expectations and promoting materialism. Response: While this may be true, it is up to individuals and parents to educate themselves and their children about responsible social media use and consumption habits.\n* **Environmental and social costs**: The production and disposal of goods driven by social media trends can have negative environmental and social impacts. Response: While these costs are real, they can be mitigated through sustainable production practices, recycling, and responsible consumption habits.\n* **Inequality and social comparison**: Social media can exacerbate feelings of inequality and social comparison, leading to decreased well-being. Response: While this may be true, social media can also provide opportunities for social connection, community building, and access to information that can improve well-being.\n\nIn conclusion, from a capitalist perspective, the phenomenon of excessive consumption driven by social media is not a problem, but rather a natural consequence of a free market economy. It is up to individuals to make responsible choices about their consumption habits, and the market will correct itself if consumers become disillusioned with products and services driven by social media trends."], "references": [null, null], "query_single": {"judge_message": "모델은 질문에 대한 답변을 영어로 제공했으며, 이는 언어 요구사항을 위반하는 것입니다. 질문은 한국어로 답변할 것을 요구했기 때문에, 모델의 응답은 평가 기준에 부합하지 않습니다. 따라서 내용의 정확성이나 완성도에 관계없이 언어 요구사항을 충족하지 못했기 때문에 점수는 0점을 부여해야 합니다.", "judge_score": 0.0}, "query_multi": {"judge_message": "모델은 질문에 대한 답변을 영어로 제공하여 언어 요구사항을 준수하지 않았습니다. 질문은 한국어로 답변을 요구했으나, 모델은 영어로 답변을 작성하여 기본적인 언어 요구사항을 충족하지 못했습니다. 이는 평가 기준에 따라 답변의 내용이나 논리적 전개 여부와 관계없이 점수를 0점으로 처리해야 함을 의미합니다. 따라서, 모델의 답변은 평가할 수 없습니다.", "judge_score": 0.0}}

The client sends a request to the server to retrieve a specific resource, and the server responds with the resource.\n\nRole: Retrieve a resource from the server.\n\nExample: `GET /index.html` retrieves the `index.html` file from the server.\n\n2. **POST**: Sends data to the server to create a new resource. The client sends a request to the server with data, and the server processes the data and creates a new resource.\n\nRole: Create a new resource on the server.\n\nExample: `POST /users` creates a new user account on the server.\n\n3. **PUT**: Updates an existing resource on the server. The client sends a request to the server with updated data, and the server updates the existing resource.\n\nRole: Update an existing resource on the server.\n\nExample: `PUT /users/123` updates the user account with ID 123 on the server.\n\n4. **DELETE**: Deletes a resource from the server. The client sends a request to the server to delete a specific resource, and the server deletes the resource.\n\nRole: Delete a resource from the server.\n\nExample: `DELETE /users/123` deletes the user account with ID 123 from the server.\n\n5. **HEAD**: Retrieves metadata about a resource without retrieving the resource itself. The client sends a request to the server to retrieve metadata about a resource, and the server responds with the metadata.\n\nRole: Retrieve metadata about a resource.\n\nExample: `HEAD /index.html` retrieves the metadata (e.g., last modified date, content type) about the `index.html` file without retrieving the file itself.\n\n**HTTP/2:**\n\nHTTP/2 is a newer version of the HTTP protocol that provides improved performance and efficiency. The major methods in HTTP/2 are similar to those in HTTP/1.1, but with some differences:\n\n* **GET**, **POST**, **PUT**, and **DELETE** methods are similar to those in HTTP/1.1.\n* **HEAD** method is not explicitly defined in HTTP/2, but it can be used as an extension.\n\nIn addition to these methods, HTTP/2 introduces new features such as:\n\n* **Server Push**: allows the server to push additional resources to the client without the client requesting them.\n* **Multiplexing**: allows multiple requests and responses to be sent over a single connection, improving performance and efficiency.\n\nOverall, HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 provide a set of methods that allow clients and servers to communicate and exchange resources over the web.", "😊\n\n`PUT` and `PATCH` are both used to update resources on a server, but they have different semantics and use cases.\n\n**PUT**:\n\n* `PUT` is used to replace an entire resource with a new version.\n* The client sends a complete representation of the resource to the server, and the server replaces the existing resource with the new one.\n* The client is responsible for sending the entire resource, including all the fields and values.\n* If the resource does not exist, `PUT` can be used to create a new resource.\n\nExample: `PUT /users/123` with a JSON payload `{\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30}` would replace the entire user resource with ID 123 with the new values.\n\n**PATCH**:\n\n* `PATCH` is used to partially update a resource.\n* The client sends a set of changes to the server, and the server applies those changes to the existing resource.\n* The client only sends the changes, not the entire resource.\n* `PATCH` is used when only a subset of fields need to be updated.\n\nExample: `PATCH /users/123` with a JSON payload `{\"age\": 31}` would update only the `age` field of the user resource with ID 123, leaving the other fields unchanged.\n\nKey differences:\n\n* `PUT` replaces the entire resource, while `PATCH` updates only the specified fields.\n* `PUT` requires the client to send the entire resource, while `PATCH` only requires the client to send the changes.\n\nWhen to use each:\n\n* Use `PUT` when you need to replace an entire resource or create a new resource.\n* Use `PATCH` when you need to update only a subset of fields in an existing resource.\n\nIn summary, `PUT` is like a \"replace\" operation, while `PATCH` is like an \"update\" operation. 💻"], "references": ["GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, HEAD, TRACE, CONNECT 중 5개를 설명", "PUT은 전체를 업데이트하는 반면, PATCH는 일부를 업데이트한다."], "query_single": {"judge_message": "모델은 HTTP/1.1 및 HTTP/2의 주요 메서드 5개와 그들의 역할에 대해 설명하라는 질문에 대해 영어로 답변하였습니다. 이는 언어 요구사항을 위반하는 것으로, 한국어로 답변해야 했습니다. 따라서 답변의 내용이 정확하고 자세하게 설명되었더라도 언어 요구사항을 충족하지 못했기 때문에 점수는 0점을 부여해야 합니다. 추가 참고 자료에 제시된 메서드들 중 5개를 설명하라는 요구사항도 충족하지 못했습니다. 또한, HTTP/2에 대한 설명에서 HEAD 메서드가 HTTP/2에서 명시적으로 정의되지 않았다고 언급하는 것은 정확하지 않습니다.
